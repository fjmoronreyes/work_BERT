Executive Summary Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (Payment Services Directive 2 – PSD2) entered into force in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2016 and applies since 13 January 2018. One of the PSD2 requirements applicable to all payment service providers (PSPs) relates to the reporting of fraud data on means of payment. More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 states that PSPs must provide ‘statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities’ and that the competent authorities (CAs) must, in turn, ‘provide EBA and the ECB with such data in an aggregated form’.	0

The EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has assessed the responses and identified approximately 200 different issues or requests for clarification that respondents had raised.	The EBA agreed with some of these proposals, and their underlying rationale, and has made a number of changes to the GL and related annexes as a result. This includes the requirements in relation to the reporting frequency, which the EBA has changed from a set of data on a quarterly frequency and a more detailed set of data on a yearly frequency to one set of data on a semi-annual frequency. The geographical area, too, has been reduced to the same area for all of the requirements in the GL (with no country-by-country data requirement), and the number of categories of fraudulent transactions to be reported has been reduced from three to two, with fraudulent transactions where the payer is the fraudster now no longer within the scope of the GL. Finally, the fraud types have been aligned across the payment services and instruments. The other requirements proposed in the CP remain unchanged, including the exclusion of account information service providers from the fraud statistics reporting obligations.	0

One of the    objectives of PSD2 is to ensure the security of electronic payments and ‘to reduce, to the maximum    extent possible, the risk of fraud’ (recital 95).	2. More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 provides that ‘Member States shall ensure that payment    service providers provide, at least on an annual basis, statistical data on fraud relating to different    means of payment to their competent authorities (CAs). Those CAs shall provide EBA and the ECB    with such data in an aggregated form’.	0

Those CAs shall provide EBA and the ECB    with such data in an aggregated form’.	3. Not all Member States (MS) currently collect fraud data for all payment instruments, and those    that do tend to use different definitions of what a fraudulent payment transaction is, different    methodologies and/or different data breakdowns. In particular, MS that currently do collect fraud    data either do not cover transactions using all payment instruments or transactions made through    all types of payment service providers (PSPs) within their jurisdiction, or the data categories and/or    level of detail differs.	0

The European System of Central Banks (ESCB), in its function as overseer of payment schemes and    instruments, collects fraud data too, but those data are limited to card payments and based on    non-legally binding reporting requirements. Additional payment statistics are collected by the ECB,    with the assistance of the euro area national central banks, from euro area PSPs and these include    data on all means of payments but do not, at the moment, include reporting of data related to    fraudulent payment transactions. 1	0

Against this background, the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has developed two sets of    Guidelines (GL) on fraud data reporting requirements. The two GL aim to ensure that the highlevel provisions in Article 96(6) PSD2 are implemented consistently across the MS of the European    Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) and that the aggregated data provided to the    EBA and the ECB are comparable and reliable.	0

The first set of GL is addressed to PSPs while the second is addressed to CAs. The first set of GL sets    out requirements applicable to all PSPs, with the exception of account information service    providers (AISPs) 2, while the second set of GL sets out requirements on providing data in an    aggregate form to the ECB and the EBA that are applicable to CAs.	0

On 2 August 2017, the EBA published a consultation paper (CP) for a three-month consultation    period.

The respondents generally agreed with the objectives listed in the CP but stated that it was unclear     whether a direct link between these GL and the Regulatory technical standards on strong customer     authentication and common and secure open standards for communication (RTS on SCA and CSC)     existed or not.

Some supported such a link while others did not, putting forward arguments     accordingly.	12. The EBA considered these arguments and arrived at the view that the GL are a tool for supervisors     to monitor compliance with PSD2 itself and the technical standards and GL that the EBA has     developed in support of the directive, including the RTS on SCA and CSC. Most of the respondents     who raised this issue specifically queried whether or not there was a link between the GL and the     calculation of the fraud rate for the purpose of the transaction-risk analysis (TRA) exemption under     Article 18 of the RTS on SCA and CSC. The EBA clarifies that the GL and the RTS on SCA and CSC are     aligned to the extent that the same two categories included in the reporting for the purpose of the     EBA GL, namely unauthorised transactions and transactions as a result of the manipulation of the     payer, should be used to calculate the fraud rate as explained in paragraph 46 of the EBA Opinion     published on 13 June 2018.	0

In addition, a number of respondents queried the link between the EBA GL and the ECB Regulation     on payment statistics (ECB/2013/43). On the basis of Article 96(6) PSD2, which refers to both the     ECB and the EBA, the objectives of the draft GL included an objective for the ESCB oversight of     payment schemes and instruments. In parallel, the ECB is currently reviewing its Regulation and     has for that purpose conducted a fact-finding exercise. This review is exploring, inter alia, whether     the scope of the Regulation can be extended to include fraud statistics to serve the ESCB’s     oversight function. In view of this development, the EBA has concluded that the EBA GL should be     primarily a tool for the purpose of supervision and that therefore the data required to be reported     should be suitable and necessary for those purposes. As a result, the EBA GL no longer require the     reporting of data that are solely relevant for oversight purposes.	0

This means that it is envisaged that the regulatory requirements related to fraud reporting consist     of two components: (i) the EBA GL, which focus on the reporting of data that are relevant mostly     for supervisory purposes, which will become applicable from January 2019 and (ii) an appropriate     ESCB regulatory tool to outline oversight-only reporting requirements for fraud data on means of     payment (e.g. potentially a revised ECB Regulation on payment statistics).	0

Some respondents disagreed with the inclusion of ‘manipulation of the payer’ and ‘payer acting     fraudulently’ in addition to ‘unauthorised transactions’ within the total of ‘fraudulent payment     transactions’, arguing that these data were unreliable or that such fraud was not within the control     of PSPs and therefore should not be reported by them. The EBA considered these arguments and     arrived at the view that, while it is important to have a complete and accurate picture of payment     fraud, fraud that is completely outside of the control of PSPs should not be included, as it is of     limited relevance and interest to the supervisors of PSPs (although it may be relevant for other     authorities, including law enforcement). The EBA has therefore concluded that the category ‘payer     acting fraudulently’ should be excluded.	0

By contrast, and although the reporting of data under the category of ‘fraud by manipulation of     the payer’ may not be completely reliable yet, the EBA is of the view that such fraud cases are     caused by a third party manipulating a payer into making a payment and that it is, at least partially,     the responsibility of the PSP to identify any such potential case. This is particularly the case with     regard to the use of transaction monitoring systems, and in particular TRA. This is of particular     concern to the EBA, given that this type of fraud has significantly increased in recent years,     suggesting that fraudsters may be shifting to this modus operandi. Therefore PSPs and CAs will     need to report data to this category alongside data in the category of unauthorised transactions.	0

With regard to the scope of the GL, the draft CP included both gross and net fraud. Many     respondents were critical of the inclusion of net fraud. They criticised the definition used as well     as questioning the practical implementation and raising methodological issues related to     calculating net fraud figures. Many of these respondents also disagreed that the inclusion of net     fraud would provide CAs, the EBA and the ECB with the information they sought, namely where     the responsibility lay and consequently who had borne the losses. They also suggested it was more     a prudential measure than a data reporting one, and therefore not relevant to these GL.	0

They also suggested it was more     a prudential measure than a data reporting one, and therefore not relevant to these GL.	26. The EBA has assessed the strength of the arguments put forward and has arrived at the conclusion     that net fraud should be removed from the GLs. Instead, the GLs now require PSPs to report the     general value of losses borne by them and by the relevant payment service user. Losses borne are     understood as the residual loss that is finally registered in the PSP’s books after any recovery of     funds has taken place. This differs from net fraud because the EBA expects one single figure for     any given period, unrelated to the payment transactions reported during that period. Since refunds     by insurance agencies are not related to fraud prevention for the purposes of PSD2, the final fraud     loss figures should not take into account such refunds. The GL require PSPs to report losses that     have been recorded in their books due to fraud during the period of reporting, irrespective of the     transactions reported during that period. Such losses are independent and separate and should be     reported under a separate heading from the rest of the data.	0

The EBA considers these arguments to be valid and has therefore agreed to postpone the first     reporting period. Given the changes expected from market participants (and in particular from     those that are not yet collecting payment data under the ECB Regulation on payment statistics),     the detailed data breakdowns and the implementation work required, the EBA has decided to	0
1-guideline.txt	    change the GL so that they now require the data collection to start in January 2019, with the     exception of the data breakdown on exemptions used when SCA was not applied, for which data     collection will start only from the date of application of the RTS on SCA and CSC on 14 September     2019. The EBA clarifies that fraudulent transactions should be assigned to a specific exemption and     thus reported under one exemption only, even though in theory more than one exemption could     have been applicable. This means that the sum of the data reported under non-SCA exemption     fields should equal the total provided separately under non-SCA field.	35. This means that the first reporting period will be H1 2019 for CAs to report data on to the ECB and     the EBA by the end of 2019. This will ensure that consistent and comparable data are collected     ahead of the date of application of the RTS on SCA and CSC for CAs and will enable the EBA to     compare the evolution of fraud across payment services and instruments.

It should be noted that the Basel II agreement considers all credit exposures carrying a risk weight of 150% or higher to be high risk assets. However, in Article 128, the CRR sets out the notion of ‘items associated with particular high risk’, which serves as a possibility to assign a 150% risk weight where this is not provided by the respective original asset class of a considered exposure. As a result, an exposure that falls under Article 128 CRR is excluded from its original exposure class and is considered instead under ‘items associated with particular high risk’ of Article 128. A high risk exposure (according to the notion provided by the Basel standard) that already receives a 150% risk weight in its original exposure class (e.g. Credit Quality Step 5 or 6 for exposures to corporates) is therefore not affected by Article 128 CRR.

Similarly, the same reasoning holds for exposures to multilateral development banks listed in Article 117(2) CRR.

It has to be noted that the main purpose of the RTS on the materiality threshold for past due exposures is to identify situations where small amounts are past due as a result of technical circumstances rather than the financial situation of the obligor and eliminate them from the estimation of risk parameters.

Since the CRR does not envisage any additional exemptions from the days past due criterion the concept of ‘technical past due’ is defined as one of the following situations:	0

In many cases the repayment of such exposures is dependent by law on the completion of certain administrative procedures, which may sometimes be lengthier than initially expected. Hence it has been specified that if the delay in payments results only from these procedures and there are no other indications of a diminished financial situation of the obligor or unlikeliness to pay, default may not be recognised until any material credit obligation of such obligors to an institution is, at the maximum, 180 days past due. It has to be noted, however, that this specific treatment should only be applied in exceptional situations and institutions should make every effort to set the repayment dates in a way that includes all procedures that have to be completed before the payment and should encourage obligors to keep to the specified repayment schedule.	0

Due to specific characteristics of factoring contracts and uncertainty regarding how to apply the past due criterion to these types of contracts, clarification on these issues had to be provided in the guidelines. For that purpose a differentiation has been made between two types of factoring arrangements based on whether the underlying receivables are recognised on the balance sheet of the institution that acts as a factor. Such a differentiation is necessary as the exposure value for the purpose of own funds requirements calculation is based on the accounting value of exposures. Therefore, where individual receivables are recognised on the balance sheet, the risk weight will apply to these individual receivables; where the receivables are not actually purchased and only the exposure to the client is recorded on the balance sheet, the appropriate risk weight will apply to this exposure.	0

On the other hand, where the factor recognises direct exposures to the debtors of the client, such exposures should be treated as purchased receivables and the counting of days past due should commence when the payment for a single receivable becomes due.	0

Since these new rules are significantly different from the currently used IAS 39 and introduce the concept of expected credit losses, which is new in the accounting framework, the EBA considers it necessary to specify the treatment of provisions under IFRS 9 – despite those rules not having entered into effect. It is consequently proposed that as a general rule all exposures classified as Stage 3, i.e. exposures treated as credit-impaired under IFRS 9, should be treated as defaulted. Only a few exceptions from that rule have been specified and these include:	0

Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit     judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the     credit institution’s assessment of credit risk.

Executive Summary Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (Payment Services Directive 2 – PSD2) entered into force in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2016 and applies since 13 January 2018. One of the PSD2 requirements applicable to all payment service providers (PSPs) relates to the reporting of fraud data on means of payment. More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 states that PSPs must provide ‘statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities’ and that the competent authorities (CAs) must, in turn, ‘provide EBA and the ECB with such data in an aggregated form’.	0

On 2 August 2017, the EBA published a consultation paper (CP) and the consultation period closed on 3 November 2017. The EBA received	48 responses to the CP representing a wide range of market participants, regulated and unregulated. The EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has assessed the responses and identified approximately 200 different issues or requests for clarification that respondents had raised.	0

The EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has assessed the responses and identified approximately 200 different issues or requests for clarification that respondents had raised.	The EBA agreed with some of these proposals, and their underlying rationale, and has made a number of changes to the GL and related annexes as a result. This includes the requirements in relation to the reporting frequency, which the EBA has changed from a set of data on a quarterly frequency and a more detailed set of data on a yearly frequency to one set of data on a semi-annual frequency. The geographical area, too, has been reduced to the same area for all of the requirements in the GL (with no country-by-country data requirement), and the number of categories of fraudulent transactions to be reported has been reduced from three to two, with fraudulent transactions where the payer is the fraudster now no longer within the scope of the GL. Finally, the fraud types have been aligned across the payment services and instruments. The other requirements proposed in the CP remain unchanged, including the exclusion of account information service providers from the fraud statistics reporting obligations.	0

The EBA has in addition made particular efforts, together with the ECB, to further align the GL with other similar reporting instruments mentioned by the respondents, in particular with the ECB Regulation on payment statistics (ECB/2013/43) applicable to PSPs within the euro area and the complementary ECB Recommendation on payment statistics (ECB/2013/44) addressed to non-euro area national central banks.	0

One of the    objectives of PSD2 is to ensure the security of electronic payments and ‘to reduce, to the maximum    extent possible, the risk of fraud’ (recital 95).	2. More specifically, Article 96(6) PSD2 provides that ‘Member States shall ensure that payment    service providers provide, at least on an annual basis, statistical data on fraud relating to different    means of payment to their competent authorities (CAs). Those CAs shall provide EBA and the ECB    with such data in an aggregated form’.	0

Those CAs shall provide EBA and the ECB    with such data in an aggregated form’.	3. Not all Member States (MS) currently collect fraud data for all payment instruments, and those    that do tend to use different definitions of what a fraudulent payment transaction is, different    methodologies and/or different data breakdowns. In particular, MS that currently do collect fraud    data either do not cover transactions using all payment instruments or transactions made through    all types of payment service providers (PSPs) within their jurisdiction, or the data categories and/or    level of detail differs.	0

The European System of Central Banks (ESCB), in its function as overseer of payment schemes and    instruments, collects fraud data too, but those data are limited to card payments and based on    non-legally binding reporting requirements. Additional payment statistics are collected by the ECB,    with the assistance of the euro area national central banks, from euro area PSPs and these include    data on all means of payments but do not, at the moment, include reporting of data related to    fraudulent payment transactions. 1	0

Against this background, the EBA, in close cooperation with the ECB, has developed two sets of    Guidelines (GL) on fraud data reporting requirements. The two GL aim to ensure that the highlevel provisions in Article 96(6) PSD2 are implemented consistently across the MS of the European    Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) and that the aggregated data provided to the    EBA and the ECB are comparable and reliable.	0

The first set of GL is addressed to PSPs while the second is addressed to CAs. The first set of GL sets    out requirements applicable to all PSPs, with the exception of account information service    providers (AISPs) 2, while the second set of GL sets out requirements on providing data in an    aggregate form to the ECB and the EBA that are applicable to CAs.	0

On 2 August 2017, the EBA published a consultation paper (CP) for a three-month consultation    period.

The respondents generally agreed with the objectives listed in the CP but stated that it was unclear     whether a direct link between these GL and the Regulatory technical standards on strong customer     authentication and common and secure open standards for communication (RTS on SCA and CSC)     existed or not.

Some supported such a link while others did not, putting forward arguments     accordingly.	12. The EBA considered these arguments and arrived at the view that the GL are a tool for supervisors     to monitor compliance with PSD2 itself and the technical standards and GL that the EBA has     developed in support of the directive, including the RTS on SCA and CSC. Most of the respondents     who raised this issue specifically queried whether or not there was a link between the GL and the     calculation of the fraud rate for the purpose of the transaction-risk analysis (TRA) exemption under     Article 18 of the RTS on SCA and CSC. The EBA clarifies that the GL and the RTS on SCA and CSC are     aligned to the extent that the same two categories included in the reporting for the purpose of the     EBA GL, namely unauthorised transactions and transactions as a result of the manipulation of the     payer, should be used to calculate the fraud rate as explained in paragraph 46 of the EBA Opinion     published on 13 June 2018.	0

In addition, a number of respondents queried the link between the EBA GL and the ECB Regulation     on payment statistics (ECB/2013/43). On the basis of Article 96(6) PSD2, which refers to both the     ECB and the EBA, the objectives of the draft GL included an objective for the ESCB oversight of     payment schemes and instruments. In parallel, the ECB is currently reviewing its Regulation and     has for that purpose conducted a fact-finding exercise. This review is exploring, inter alia, whether     the scope of the Regulation can be extended to include fraud statistics to serve the ESCB’s     oversight function. In view of this development, the EBA has concluded that the EBA GL should be     primarily a tool for the purpose of supervision and that therefore the data required to be reported     should be suitable and necessary for those purposes. As a result, the EBA GL no longer require the     reporting of data that are solely relevant for oversight purposes.	0

Some respondents disagreed with the inclusion of ‘manipulation of the payer’ and ‘payer acting     fraudulently’ in addition to ‘unauthorised transactions’ within the total of ‘fraudulent payment     transactions’, arguing that these data were unreliable or that such fraud was not within the control     of PSPs and therefore should not be reported by them. The EBA considered these arguments and     arrived at the view that, while it is important to have a complete and accurate picture of payment     fraud, fraud that is completely outside of the control of PSPs should not be included, as it is of     limited relevance and interest to the supervisors of PSPs (although it may be relevant for other     authorities, including law enforcement). The EBA has therefore concluded that the category ‘payer     acting fraudulently’ should be excluded.	0

By contrast, and although the reporting of data under the category of ‘fraud by manipulation of     the payer’ may not be completely reliable yet, the EBA is of the view that such fraud cases are     caused by a third party manipulating a payer into making a payment and that it is, at least partially,     the responsibility of the PSP to identify any such potential case. This is particularly the case with     regard to the use of transaction monitoring systems, and in particular TRA. This is of particular     concern to the EBA, given that this type of fraud has significantly increased in recent years,     suggesting that fraudsters may be shifting to this modus operandi. Therefore PSPs and CAs will     need to report data to this category alongside data in the category of unauthorised transactions.	0

With regard to the scope of the GL, the draft CP included both gross and net fraud. Many     respondents were critical of the inclusion of net fraud. They criticised the definition used as well     as questioning the practical implementation and raising methodological issues related to     calculating net fraud figures. Many of these respondents also disagreed that the inclusion of net     fraud would provide CAs, the EBA and the ECB with the information they sought, namely where     the responsibility lay and consequently who had borne the losses. They also suggested it was more     a prudential measure than a data reporting one, and therefore not relevant to these GL.	0

The EBA has assessed the strength of the arguments put forward and has arrived at the conclusion     that net fraud should be removed from the GLs. Instead, the GLs now require PSPs to report the     general value of losses borne by them and by the relevant payment service user. Losses borne are     understood as the residual loss that is finally registered in the PSP’s books after any recovery of     funds has taken place. This differs from net fraud because the EBA expects one single figure for     any given period, unrelated to the payment transactions reported during that period. Since refunds     by insurance agencies are not related to fraud prevention for the purposes of PSD2, the final fraud     loss figures should not take into account such refunds. The GL require PSPs to report losses that     have been recorded in their books due to fraud during the period of reporting, irrespective of the     transactions reported during that period. Such losses are independent and separate and should be     reported under a separate heading from the rest of the data.	0

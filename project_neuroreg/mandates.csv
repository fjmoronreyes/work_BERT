10-guideline.txt	   63.In order to mitigate sufficiently any conflict of interest in managing NPEs, as well as to make       good use of dedicated NPE expertise across the organisation, credit institutions should       establish dedicated NPE workout units (NPE WUs) that are independent from loan origination       activities. 	This separation of duties approach should encompass not only client relationship       activities (e.g. negotiation of forbearance solutions with clients) but also the decision-making       process. In this context, credit institutions should consider implementing dedicated decisionmaking bodies related to NPE workout (e.g. an NPE committee).	1

Credit institutions should consider designing customised processes for         each portfolio, with a dedicated expert team taking ownership of each. NPE portfolios should         be analysed with a high degree of granularity, resulting in clearly defined borrower         subportfolios. For these analyses, credit institutions should develop appropriate         management information systems and sufficiently high data quality.	1

10-guideline.txt	     78.Based on the findings of the credit institution’s NPE self-assessment on capabilities, as         referred to in section 4.2.1, credit institutions should regularly review the adequacy of their         internal and external NPE workout resources and address any human resourcing gaps in a         timely fashion. As workout activities may place significant demands on resources, credit         institutions should consider if it is appropriate to choose to use fixed-term contracts,         internal/external outsourcing or joint ventures for NPE workout activities. However, the final         responsibility for these activities remains with the credit institution. In the event that         outsourcing is used, credit institutions should ensure that such outsourcing is arranged in         accordance with the applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.	     79.Credit institutions should build up the relevant expertise required for the defined NPE         operating model, including the NPE WUs and internal control functions, in line with the         provisions of the joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of         members of the management body and key function holders.26 Staff allocated to key NPE         workout tasks should have specific NPE expertise and experience. Credit institutions should         implement adequate and dedicated NPE training, including on consumer protection, and         should design staff development plans to build in-house expertise using available talent.	0
10-guideline.txt	     80.Where it is not possible or efficient to build in-house expertise and infrastructure, the NPE         WUs should have easy access to qualified independent external resources (e.g. property         appraisers, legal advisors, business planners, industry experts) or to dedicated NPE servicing         companies.	     81.The credit institution, in alignment with the overall NPE strategy and operational plan, should         implement an appraisal system tailored to the requirements of the NPE WUs.

In particular, effective and efficient          internal control processes should be implemented for the NPE workout framework in order          to ensure full alignment between the NPE strategy and operational plan on the one hand and          the credit institution’s overall business strategy, including the NPE strategy and operational          plan, and risk appetite on the other hand.	      88.Internal control functions should regularly submit to the management body written reports          on NPE management highlighting major identified deficiencies. These reports should include,          for each new identified major deficiency, the relevant risks involved, an impact assessment,          recommendations and corrective measures to be taken. Where necessary, the heads of          internal control functions should be able to have access to and report directly to the          management body in its supervisory function to raise concerns and warn the supervisory          function, where appropriate, when specific developments affect or may affect the          institution. This should not prevent the heads of internal control functions from reporting          within regular reporting lines as well.	0

Key outcomes of second- and          third-line activities as well as defined mitigating actions and progress on those needs should          be reported to the management body regularly.	0
10-guideline.txt	      91.In the implementation of the control framework, larger and more complex credit institutions          should apply all three lines of defence; the second line of defence does not have to be NPE          specific and may be performed by the credit risk (control) function.	      92.In the implementation of the control framework, smaller and less complex credit institutions          (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3 or 4) do not necessarily have to have three          fully fledged NPE-specific lines of defence, but they have to ensure that any conflict of          interest is sufficiently mitigated.	0
10-guideline.txt	   93.Credit institutions should ensure that the first line of defence is embedded into the       procedures and processes of the operational units, mainly the NPE WUs, that actually own       and manage the credit institution’s risks in the specific context of NPE workout.	   94.In order to ensure that adequate control mechanisms are implemented, credit institutions       should have internal policies in place on the NPE workout framework. The managers of the       operational units are responsible for ensuring that these internal policies are implemented,       including through their incorporation into IT procedures. Annex 4 to these guidelines sets out       key elements of NPE framework-related policies that should be implemented in credit       institutions.	0
10-guideline.txt	   95.Second line of defence functions should perform controls on a continuous basis to check that       NPE management in the first line of defence is operating as intended. To adequately perform       their control tasks, second-line functions require a strong degree of independence from       functions performing business activities, including the NPE WUs, and should have sufficient       resources. They should have an adequate number of qualified staff. The qualifications of staff       should be reassessed on an ongoing basis, and staff should receive training as necessary.	   98.The third line of defence, the independent internal audit function, should have sufficient NPE       workout expertise to perform its periodic control activities on the efficiency and       effectiveness of the NPE framework, including the first- and second-line controls.	0
10-guideline.txt	   99.With regard to the NPE framework, the internal audit function should, at least, perform       regular assessments to monitor adherence to internal NPE-related policies (see Annex 4) and       to this guidance. This should also include random and unannounced inspections and credit       file reviews.	   100. In determining the frequency, scope and scale of the controls to be carried out, credit       institutions should take into account the level of NPEs and whether significant irregularities       and weaknesses have been identified by recent audits.	0
10-guideline.txt	   101. Based on the results of its controls, the internal audit function should make       recommendations to the management body, bringing possible improvements to their       attention.	102. The monitoring systems should be based on the NPE targets approved in the NPE strategy       and related operational plan, which are subsequently cascaded down to the operational       targets of the NPE WUs, with feedback loops to pricing of credit risk and provisioning. A       related framework of NPE-related key performance indicators (KPIs) should be developed to       allow the management body and other relevant managers to measure progress.	0
10-guideline.txt	   105. Credit institutions should carry out such monitoring activities at transaction/borrower       level, and portfolio or subportfolio levels, as appropriate, considering aspects such as       business line, borrower segment, geographical area, products, concentration risk, level of       collateralisation and type of collateral provided, and debt-service ability.	   106. Credit institutions should monitor the level of impairments of NPEs in order to provide the       management body with comprehensive information on coverage. The analysis should       include data on the aggregate level as well as the levels for different NPE portfolios. The       selection of NPE portfolios should consider aspects such as type of exposure, including       secured/unsecured, type of collateral and guarantees, geographical area, number of years       since NPE classification, time to recovery, and the use of the going and gone concern       approach. Coverage movements should also be monitored and reductions clearly explained.	0
10-guideline.txt	   107. Credit institutions should benchmark indicators related to the NPE ratio and coverage       against the available indicators of peers in order to provide the management body with a       clear picture of the competitive position and potential shortcomings.	   108. Credit institutions should monitor their deviations from the budget, in order for the       management body to understand the drivers of significant deviations from the plan.	0
10-guideline.txt	   109. Key figures on NPE inflows and outflows should be included in periodic reporting to the       management body, including transfers from/to NPEs, non-performing FBEs, NPEs under       probation, performing FBEs and early arrears (≤ 90 days past due).	   110. Credit institutions should consider if it would be useful to establish migration matrices to       track the flow of exposures into and out of non-performing classification.	0
10-guideline.txt	   111. Credit institutions should estimate the migration rates and the quality of the performing       exposures month by month, so that actions can be prioritised and taken promptly to inhibit       deterioration of portfolio quality. Migration matrices can be further broken down by       exposure type (retail mortgage, consumer, real estate), by business unit or by other       subportfolio to identify whether the driver of the flows can be attributed to a specific       subportfolio.	   112. In their monitoring activities, credit institutions should use internal information (e.g. from       internal score systems) and external information (e.g. from rating agencies, credit bureaus,       specialised sector research or macroeconomic indicators for specific geographical areas) and       should refer to a particular point in time or observation period.

If no such indicators exist or are available, key	0
10-guideline.txt	     114. To resolve or limit the impact of NPEs, credit institutions should explore the possibilities         with regard to granting forbearance measures. Credit institutions should monitor two         aspects of the forbearance activities, efficiency and effectiveness. Section 7 specifies the         requirements relating to the application of forbearance measures.	     115. The main objective of forbearance measures should be the return of the borrower to a         sustainable performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and         minimising expected losses. This objectives should take into account the importance of         ensuring the fair treatment of consumers and compliance with any consumer protection         requirements that may be applicable. The credit institution should monitor the quality of the         forbearance activities to make sure that they are not used to delay impairments or an         assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring should cover forbearance         activities in relation to both performing and non-performing exposures.	0
10-guideline.txt	     116. If no sustainable restructuring solution can be reached, credit institutions should still         resolve the NPE. Resolution may involve initiating legal procedures, foreclosing assets, debt         to asset/equity swap, disposal of credit facilities by sale, transferal to an asset management         company or securitisation. Where the price obtained from the foreclosure of immovable         property affects the amount owed by a consumer, credit institutions should take into         account, when deciding on the liquidation measure and next steps, the provisions of         Article 17(5) of Directive 2014/17/EU,31 to the extent applicable.	     117. Liquidation activities should be monitored by the credit institution to help inform strategies         and policies. Credit institutions should monitor disposals and monitor realised sales/transfer         prices against net carrying amounts.	0
10-guideline.txt	     118. Credit institutions should monitor the volumes and recovery rates of legal and foreclosure         cases. Performance in this regard should be measured against set targets, in terms of number         of months/years and loss to the institution. In monitoring the actual loss rate, institutions are         expected to build historical time series for each loan portfolio to back up the assumptions         used for impairment review purposes and stress test exercises.	     119. For exposures covered by collateral or another type of guarantee, credit institutions should         monitor the time period needed to liquidate the collateral or to enforce a guarantee. Credit         institutions should also monitor potential forced sale haircuts upon liquidation and	0
10-guideline.txt	   120. Monitoring the recovery rates from foreclosure and other legal proceedings should help       credit institutions to reliably assess whether the decision to foreclose will provide a higher       net present value than pursuing a forbearance option. The data regarding the recovery rates       from foreclosures should be monitored on an ongoing basis and feed into potential       amendments to credit institutions’ strategies for handling their debt recovery/legal       portfolios.	   121. Credit institutions should also monitor the average duration of legal procedures recently       completed and the average amounts recovered (including related recovery costs) from these       completed procedures.	0

Credit institutions should carefully monitor cases where the debt is swapped with an asset       or equity of the borrower, at least by using volume indicators by type of assets, and ensure       compliance with any limits set by the relevant national regulations on holdings. The use of       this approach as a forbearance measure should be backed by a proper business plan and       limited to assets in relation to which the institution has sufficient expertise and the market       realistically allows the determined value to be extracted from the asset in the short to       medium term. The institution should also make sure that the valuation of the assets is carried       out by qualified and experienced appraisers.	   123. Credit institutions should monitor and report to their management bodies the amount of       interest income stemming from NPEs. In addition, a distinction should be made between the       interest payments on NPEs actually received and those not actually received. The evolution       of loss allowances and the related drivers should also be monitored.	0

If foreclosure is a part of a credit institution’s NPE strategy, it should also monitor the       volume, ageing, coverage and flows of foreclosed assets (or other assets stemming from       NPEs) at a sufficient level of granularity to take into account material types of assets. The       performance of the foreclosed assets vis-a-vis the predefined business plan should be       monitored and reported to the management body and other relevant managers on an       aggregate level.	125. Credit institutions should use the definitions of forbearance measures and FBEs as stated          in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 in their risk          management. Forbearance measures should aim to return the borrower to a sustainable          performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and minimising expected          losses. When deciding on which steps or forbearance measures to take, credit institutions          should take into account the interests of consumers and comply with consumer protection          requirements, including those set out in Article 28 of Directive 2014/17/EU32 and in the EBA          Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure.33 Credit institutions should monitor the efficiency and          effectiveness of forbearance activities.	0

Credit institutions should consider using a combination of different forbearance measures,          including both short-term and long-term time horizons in line with the nature and maturity          of the credit facilities. Credit institutions should consider the list of possible forbearance          measures in Annex 5.	      128. Credit institutions should use forbearance measures with time horizons shorter than two          years (one year in the case of project finance and the construction of commercial property)          where such measures do not address the resolution of outstanding arrears, unless such          measures are combined with forbearance measures that are longer than two years.	0
10-guideline.txt	   136. Credit institutions should monitor the quality of forbearance activities to make sure that       they are not used to delay an assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring       should cover forbearance activities relating to both performing and non-performing       exposures and differentiate between types of forbearance measures and portfolios.	   137. Credit institutions should measure the efficiency of the process for granting forbearance       measures and monitor the duration of the decision-making process and the volumes of       forbearance measures at each stage of the granting process.	0
10-guideline.txt	   138. Credit institutions should monitor effectiveness of forbearance measures granted. This       monitoring should measure the degree of success of the forbearance measure and whether       the modified contractual obligations of the borrower are met and the exposure is       performing. The following metrics by portfolio and by type of forbearance measure should       be used:	   139. Credit institutions should monitor indicators relating to forbearance activities using a       meaningful breakdown, which could include the type and duration of arrears, the type of       exposure, the probability of recovery, the size of the exposures or the total amount of       exposures to the same borrower or group of connected clients, and the number of       forbearance solutions applied in the past.	0
10-guideline.txt	   140. Before granting any forbearance measures, credit institutions should assess the borrower’s       repayment capacity. This should include an adequate assessment of the borrower’s financial       situation, based on sufficient information and taking into account relevant factors such as       the debt-servicing capacity and overall indebtedness of the borrower or the       property/project.	   141. Credit institutions should have adequate policies and procedures in place with a range of       sustainable and effective solutions for the borrower when granting forbearance. The       grouping of exposures into portfolios should be reflected in these policies and procedures,       to enable credit institutions to adopt different forbearance measures for different segments       of borrowers and tailor measures to them.	0
10-guideline.txt	   142. Credit institutions should consider developing decision trees and standardised forbearance       measures for portfolios of homogeneous borrowers with less complex exposures.

These milestones/targets should be credible,         be appropriately conservative and take account of any potential deterioration in the         borrower’s financial situation. The performance of the forborne borrower, including the         borrower’s compliance with all agreed targets, should be closely monitored by the NPE WU         responsible for granting the forbearance, at least for the duration of the probation period.	7.

Credit institutions should reclassify NPEs, including FBEs, as performing in accordance with       Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014. Credit institutions       should perform a financial analysis of the borrower to establish the absence of concerns       regarding the borrower’s ability to pay its credit obligations.	0
10-guideline.txt	   158. Credit institutions’ policies for the reclassification of non-performing FBEs should specify       practices for dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to comply with the postforbearance conditions set out in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)       No 680/2014. These policies should establish criteria in terms of payments made during the       cure period of at least one year and define the borrower’s ability to comply with postforbearance conditions (to the extent that full repayment of the debt is likely) without being       reliant on the realisation of collateral at least by demonstrating payments of a not       insignificant amount of principal. These policies should require payments of both principal       and interest.	   159. In addition, where a borrower has other exposures to a credit institution that are not the       subject of a forbearance measure, the credit institution should consider the impact and the       performance of these exposures in its assessment of the borrower’s ability to comply with       post-forbearance conditions. The consideration of arrears should not change the level of       application of non-performing status, in accordance with Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, and only exposures to which forbearance       measures have been applied should be identified as FBEs.	0
10-guideline.txt	   160. The existence of contract terms that extend the repayment period, such as grace periods       for the principal, should confirm the classification of these FBEs as non-performing until the       requirements of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have       been satisfied. The fact that the one-year cure period has elapsed should not automatically       lead to reclassification to performing unless regular payments have been made over these	   161. Once FBEs are classified as performing, either because they have met the conditions for       being reclassified from the non-performing category or because the granting of forbearance       measures did not lead to the classification of the exposure as non-performing, they should       continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions for the discontinuation of the       classification of exposures as forborne under paragraph 256 of Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have been met.	0
10-guideline.txt	      165.

Credit institutions’          policies should also ensure a consistent assessment of the underlying legal relationships          between legal entities across a group of connected clients. In view of possible contagion,          credit institutions should, whenever feasible, apply a group perspective when assessing the          status of a borrower’s exposure as non-performing, unless it is affected by isolated disputes          that are unrelated to the solvency of the counterparty.	174. Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to sound policies, procedures and          controls for assessing and measuring loss allowances and write-off on NPEs in accordance          with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected          credit losses.

Competent authorities should bear in mind that more than one fee or type of fee might relate to the same service within their Member State. Each fee does not need to be considered as a separate service. Competent authorities should take into consideration that different PSPs may have different fee structures for the same service. Therefore, when determining which services to consider including on their list, competent authorities should first consider what the provided ‘service’ is.	0

For prudential purposes, credit institutions should update valuations of all secured       exposures in accordance with the requirements of Article 208(3) and Article 210(c) of       Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	Many services may be delivered through different channels. For instance, certain payment transactions might incur different fees depending on whether they are made online, by telephone or in branch. As the pricing differentiation might be particularly pertinent to customers if the costs vary significantly between channels, competent authorities are asked to indicate this in the template. Subsequently, a fee, even if the charge differs depending on the channel used, should be considered as one in the list of 10–20 fees; PSPs will still be able to disclose the range of fees for that one service in the FID. It is recognised however that the facility to use a particular channel might in itself constitute the service (e.g. if a customer is charged a fee to be able to use telephone banking).	0
10-guideline.txt	   198. The group of collaterals that are subject to individual valuations and revaluations on a       regular basis should be updated at the time when the exposure is classified as nonperforming and at least annually while it continues to be classified as such. Credit institutions       should make sure that, for the collateral subject to indexation or other similar methods, the       indexation is updated at least annually.	Regular ‘maintenance’ fees on a payment account might cover a range of payment services (e.g. ATM withdrawals, in-branch transactions). In some cases, the use of such services might be restricted, such as by the number of transactions permitted. Additional transactions might or might not attract a separate, additional fee. Competent authorities may therefore consider that it is appropriate, according to the criteria, to include separately in their provisional list the services covered by the maintenance fee if within that Member State they are liable to attract a fee. Competent authorities should note that in making this determination, Article 4(3) of the Directive requires the services included in packages of this type and any such additional fees to be disclosed in the FID.	0

For example, in    specific cases where a special purpose entity that is controlled by another client (e.g. an    originator) is fully ring-fenced and bankruptcy remote – so that there is no possible channel of    contagion, and hence no single risk, between the special purpose entity and the controlling entity    – it may be possible to demonstrate that no single risk exists (see scenario C 1 in the annex).	28.Institutions should consider situations where the funding problems of one client are likely to    spread to another on account of a one-way or two-way dependency on the same funding source.

Institutions should also investigate, and document as appropriate, any potential    economic dependencies among their clients. Institutions should take reasonable steps and use    readily available information to identify these connections. If, for example, an institution becomes    aware that clients have been considered interconnected by another institution (e.g. because of    the existence of a public register), it should take into account that information.	4.

Where the institution recognises events related to dilution risk of purchased receivables as     defined in point (53) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, these events should not     be considered as leading to the default of the obligor. Where the amount of receivable has     been reduced as a result of events related to dilution risk such as discounts, deductions,     netting or credit notes issued by the seller the reduced amount of receivable should be     included in the calculation of days past due.

Where the credit arrangement explicitly allows the obligor to change the schedule, suspend     or postpone the payments under certain conditions and the obligor acts within the rights     granted in the contract, the changed, suspended or postponed instalments should not be     considered past due, but the counting of days past due should be based on the new schedule     once it is specified. Nevertheless if the obligor changes the schedule, suspends or postpones     the payments, the institutions should analyse the reasons for such a change and assess the     possible indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines.	31. Where the obligor has not been adequately informed about the cession of the receivable by     the factor’s client and the institution has evidence that the payment for the receivable has     been made to the client, the institution should not consider the receivable to be past due.

Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or     any other similar transaction, the counting of days past due should start from the moment a     different person or entity becomes obliged to pay the obligation. The counting of days past     due is, instead, unaffected by a change in the obligor’s name.	34. Institutions should apply the materiality threshold for past due credit obligations set by their     competent authorities as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013. Institutions may identify defaults on the basis of a lower threshold if they can     demonstrate that this lower threshold is a relevant indication of unlikeliness to pay and does     not lead to an excessive number of defaults that return to non-defaulted status shortly after     being recognised as defaulted or decrease of capital requirements. In this case institutions     should record in their databases the information on the trigger of default as an additional     specified indication of unlikeliness to pay.	0

The calculation of the sum of all amounts past due that are related to any credit obligation of     the obligor to the institution, parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries to this obligor and     which institutions are required to calculate for the purpose of comparison with the     materiality threshold set by the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article     178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be performed with a frequency allowing timely     identification of default. Institutions should ensure that the information about the days past     due and default is up-to-date whenever it’s being used for decision making, internal risk     management, internal or external reporting and the own funds requirements calculation     processes. Where institutions calculate days past due less often than daily, they should     ensure that the date of default is identified as the date when the past due criterion has     actually been fulfilled.	5.

The SCRA that cover the losses for which historical experience, adjusted on the basis of     current observable data, indicate that the loss has occurred but the institution is not yet     aware which individual exposure has suffered these losses (‘incurred but not reported     losses’), should not be considered an indication of unlikeliness to pay of a specific obligor.

For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (a) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should consider that an obligor is unlikely to pay     where interest related to credit obligations is no longer recognised in the income statement     of the institution due to the decrease of the credit quality of the obligation.	0
15-guideline.txt	41. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (c) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account both the character and     materiality of the loss related to the sale of credit obligations, in accordance with the     following paragraphs. Transactions of traditional securitisation with significant risk transfer     and any intragroup sales of credit obligations should be considered sale of credit obligations.	45. In order to assess the materiality of the overall economic loss related with the sale of credit     obligations, institutions should calculate the economic loss and compare it to the threshold     referred to in paragraph 44. Where the economic loss is higher than this threshold they     should consider the credit obligations defaulted.	0
15-guideline.txt	42. Institutions should analyse the reasons for the sale of credit obligations and the reasons for     any losses recognised thereby. Where the reasons for the sale of credit obligations were not     related to credit risk, such as where there is the need to increase the liquidity of the     institution or there is a change in business strategy, and the institution does not perceive the     credit quality of those obligations as declined, the economic loss related with the sale of     those obligations should be considered not credit-related. In that case the sale should not be     considered an indication of default even where the loss is material, on condition of the     appropriate, documented justification of the treatment of the sale loss as not credit-related.     Institutions may, in particular, consider the loss on the sale of credit obligations as non-credit     related where the assets subject to the sale are publicly traded assets and measured at fair     value.	46. The sale of credit obligations may be performed either before or after the default. In the case     of institutions that use the IRB Approach, regardless of the moment of the sale, if the sale was     related with a material credit-related economic loss, the information about the loss should be     adequately recorded and stored for the purpose of the estimation of risk parameters.	0

If the sale of a credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss occurred before the     identification of default on that exposure, the moment of sale should be considered the     moment of default. In the case of a partial sale of the total obligations of an obligor where the     sale is associated to a material credit-related economic loss, all the remaining exposures to     this obligor should be treated as defaulted, unless the exposures are eligible as retail     exposures and the institution applies the default definition at facility level.	0
15-guideline.txt	43. Where, however, the loss on the sale of credit obligations is related to the credit quality of     the obligations themselves, in particular where the institution sells the credit obligations due     to the decrease in their quality, the institution should analyse the materiality of the economic     loss and, where the economic loss is material, this should be considered an indication of     default.	48. In the case of a sale of a portfolio of exposures the treatment of individual credit obligations     within this portfolio should be determined in accordance with the manner the price for the     portfolio was set. Where the price for the total portfolio was determined by specifying the     discount on particular credit obligations, the materiality of credit-related economic loss     should be assessed individually for each exposure within the portfolio. Where however the     price was set only at the portfolio level, the materiality of credit-related economic loss may be     assessed at the portfolio level and in that case, if the threshold specified in paragraph 44 is	0

Given that, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the     obligor should be considered defaulted where the distressed restructuring is likely to result in     a diminished financial obligation, where considering forborne exposures, the obligor should     be classified as defaulted only where the relevant forbearance measures are likely to result in     a diminished financial obligation.	55. Where any of the modifications of the schedule of credit obligations referred to in point (e) of     Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is the result of financial difficulties of an     obligor, institutions should also assess whether a distressed restructuring has taken place and     whether an indication of unlikeliness to pay has occurred.	0

10-guideline.txt	   63.In order to mitigate sufficiently any conflict of interest in managing NPEs, as well as to make       good use of dedicated NPE expertise across the organisation, credit institutions should       establish dedicated NPE workout units (NPE WUs) that are independent from loan origination       activities. 	This separation of duties approach should encompass not only client relationship       activities (e.g. negotiation of forbearance solutions with clients) but also the decision-making       process. In this context, credit institutions should consider implementing dedicated decisionmaking bodies related to NPE workout (e.g. an NPE committee).	1

Credit institutions should consider designing customised processes for         each portfolio, with a dedicated expert team taking ownership of each. NPE portfolios should         be analysed with a high degree of granularity, resulting in clearly defined borrower         subportfolios. For these analyses, credit institutions should develop appropriate         management information systems and sufficiently high data quality.	1

10-guideline.txt	     78.Based on the findings of the credit institution’s NPE self-assessment on capabilities, as         referred to in section 4.2.1, credit institutions should regularly review the adequacy of their         internal and external NPE workout resources and address any human resourcing gaps in a         timely fashion. As workout activities may place significant demands on resources, credit         institutions should consider if it is appropriate to choose to use fixed-term contracts,         internal/external outsourcing or joint ventures for NPE workout activities. However, the final         responsibility for these activities remains with the credit institution. In the event that         outsourcing is used, credit institutions should ensure that such outsourcing is arranged in         accordance with the applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.	     79.Credit institutions should build up the relevant expertise required for the defined NPE         operating model, including the NPE WUs and internal control functions, in line with the         provisions of the joint ESMA and EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of         members of the management body and key function holders.26 Staff allocated to key NPE         workout tasks should have specific NPE expertise and experience. Credit institutions should         implement adequate and dedicated NPE training, including on consumer protection, and         should design staff development plans to build in-house expertise using available talent.	0
10-guideline.txt	     80.Where it is not possible or efficient to build in-house expertise and infrastructure, the NPE         WUs should have easy access to qualified independent external resources (e.g. property         appraisers, legal advisors, business planners, industry experts) or to dedicated NPE servicing         companies.	     81.The credit institution, in alignment with the overall NPE strategy and operational plan, should         implement an appraisal system tailored to the requirements of the NPE WUs.

In particular, effective and efficient          internal control processes should be implemented for the NPE workout framework in order          to ensure full alignment between the NPE strategy and operational plan on the one hand and          the credit institution’s overall business strategy, including the NPE strategy and operational          plan, and risk appetite on the other hand.	      88.Internal control functions should regularly submit to the management body written reports          on NPE management highlighting major identified deficiencies. These reports should include,          for each new identified major deficiency, the relevant risks involved, an impact assessment,          recommendations and corrective measures to be taken. Where necessary, the heads of          internal control functions should be able to have access to and report directly to the          management body in its supervisory function to raise concerns and warn the supervisory          function, where appropriate, when specific developments affect or may affect the          institution. This should not prevent the heads of internal control functions from reporting          within regular reporting lines as well.	0

Key outcomes of second- and          third-line activities as well as defined mitigating actions and progress on those needs should          be reported to the management body regularly.	0
10-guideline.txt	      91.In the implementation of the control framework, larger and more complex credit institutions          should apply all three lines of defence; the second line of defence does not have to be NPE          specific and may be performed by the credit risk (control) function.	      92.In the implementation of the control framework, smaller and less complex credit institutions          (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3 or 4) do not necessarily have to have three          fully fledged NPE-specific lines of defence, but they have to ensure that any conflict of          interest is sufficiently mitigated.	0
10-guideline.txt	   93.Credit institutions should ensure that the first line of defence is embedded into the       procedures and processes of the operational units, mainly the NPE WUs, that actually own       and manage the credit institution’s risks in the specific context of NPE workout.	   94.In order to ensure that adequate control mechanisms are implemented, credit institutions       should have internal policies in place on the NPE workout framework. The managers of the       operational units are responsible for ensuring that these internal policies are implemented,       including through their incorporation into IT procedures. Annex 4 to these guidelines sets out       key elements of NPE framework-related policies that should be implemented in credit       institutions.	0
10-guideline.txt	   95.Second line of defence functions should perform controls on a continuous basis to check that       NPE management in the first line of defence is operating as intended. To adequately perform       their control tasks, second-line functions require a strong degree of independence from       functions performing business activities, including the NPE WUs, and should have sufficient       resources. They should have an adequate number of qualified staff. The qualifications of staff       should be reassessed on an ongoing basis, and staff should receive training as necessary.	   98.The third line of defence, the independent internal audit function, should have sufficient NPE       workout expertise to perform its periodic control activities on the efficiency and       effectiveness of the NPE framework, including the first- and second-line controls.	0
10-guideline.txt	   99.With regard to the NPE framework, the internal audit function should, at least, perform       regular assessments to monitor adherence to internal NPE-related policies (see Annex 4) and       to this guidance. This should also include random and unannounced inspections and credit       file reviews.	   100. In determining the frequency, scope and scale of the controls to be carried out, credit       institutions should take into account the level of NPEs and whether significant irregularities       and weaknesses have been identified by recent audits.	0
10-guideline.txt	   101. Based on the results of its controls, the internal audit function should make       recommendations to the management body, bringing possible improvements to their       attention.	102. The monitoring systems should be based on the NPE targets approved in the NPE strategy       and related operational plan, which are subsequently cascaded down to the operational       targets of the NPE WUs, with feedback loops to pricing of credit risk and provisioning. A       related framework of NPE-related key performance indicators (KPIs) should be developed to       allow the management body and other relevant managers to measure progress.	0
10-guideline.txt	   105. Credit institutions should carry out such monitoring activities at transaction/borrower       level, and portfolio or subportfolio levels, as appropriate, considering aspects such as       business line, borrower segment, geographical area, products, concentration risk, level of       collateralisation and type of collateral provided, and debt-service ability.	   106. Credit institutions should monitor the level of impairments of NPEs in order to provide the       management body with comprehensive information on coverage. The analysis should       include data on the aggregate level as well as the levels for different NPE portfolios. The       selection of NPE portfolios should consider aspects such as type of exposure, including       secured/unsecured, type of collateral and guarantees, geographical area, number of years       since NPE classification, time to recovery, and the use of the going and gone concern       approach. Coverage movements should also be monitored and reductions clearly explained.	0
10-guideline.txt	   107. Credit institutions should benchmark indicators related to the NPE ratio and coverage       against the available indicators of peers in order to provide the management body with a       clear picture of the competitive position and potential shortcomings.	   108. Credit institutions should monitor their deviations from the budget, in order for the       management body to understand the drivers of significant deviations from the plan.	0
10-guideline.txt	   109. Key figures on NPE inflows and outflows should be included in periodic reporting to the       management body, including transfers from/to NPEs, non-performing FBEs, NPEs under       probation, performing FBEs and early arrears (≤ 90 days past due).	   110. Credit institutions should consider if it would be useful to establish migration matrices to       track the flow of exposures into and out of non-performing classification.	0
10-guideline.txt	   111. Credit institutions should estimate the migration rates and the quality of the performing       exposures month by month, so that actions can be prioritised and taken promptly to inhibit       deterioration of portfolio quality. Migration matrices can be further broken down by       exposure type (retail mortgage, consumer, real estate), by business unit or by other       subportfolio to identify whether the driver of the flows can be attributed to a specific       subportfolio.	   112. In their monitoring activities, credit institutions should use internal information (e.g. from       internal score systems) and external information (e.g. from rating agencies, credit bureaus,       specialised sector research or macroeconomic indicators for specific geographical areas) and       should refer to a particular point in time or observation period.

If no such indicators exist or are available, key	0
10-guideline.txt	     114. To resolve or limit the impact of NPEs, credit institutions should explore the possibilities         with regard to granting forbearance measures. Credit institutions should monitor two         aspects of the forbearance activities, efficiency and effectiveness. Section 7 specifies the         requirements relating to the application of forbearance measures.	     115. The main objective of forbearance measures should be the return of the borrower to a         sustainable performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and         minimising expected losses. This objectives should take into account the importance of         ensuring the fair treatment of consumers and compliance with any consumer protection         requirements that may be applicable. The credit institution should monitor the quality of the         forbearance activities to make sure that they are not used to delay impairments or an         assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring should cover forbearance         activities in relation to both performing and non-performing exposures.	0
10-guideline.txt	     116. If no sustainable restructuring solution can be reached, credit institutions should still         resolve the NPE. Resolution may involve initiating legal procedures, foreclosing assets, debt         to asset/equity swap, disposal of credit facilities by sale, transferal to an asset management         company or securitisation. Where the price obtained from the foreclosure of immovable         property affects the amount owed by a consumer, credit institutions should take into         account, when deciding on the liquidation measure and next steps, the provisions of         Article 17(5) of Directive 2014/17/EU,31 to the extent applicable.	     117. Liquidation activities should be monitored by the credit institution to help inform strategies         and policies. Credit institutions should monitor disposals and monitor realised sales/transfer         prices against net carrying amounts.	0
10-guideline.txt	     118. Credit institutions should monitor the volumes and recovery rates of legal and foreclosure         cases. Performance in this regard should be measured against set targets, in terms of number         of months/years and loss to the institution. In monitoring the actual loss rate, institutions are         expected to build historical time series for each loan portfolio to back up the assumptions         used for impairment review purposes and stress test exercises.	     119. For exposures covered by collateral or another type of guarantee, credit institutions should         monitor the time period needed to liquidate the collateral or to enforce a guarantee. Credit         institutions should also monitor potential forced sale haircuts upon liquidation and	0
10-guideline.txt	   120. Monitoring the recovery rates from foreclosure and other legal proceedings should help       credit institutions to reliably assess whether the decision to foreclose will provide a higher       net present value than pursuing a forbearance option. The data regarding the recovery rates       from foreclosures should be monitored on an ongoing basis and feed into potential       amendments to credit institutions’ strategies for handling their debt recovery/legal       portfolios.	   121. Credit institutions should also monitor the average duration of legal procedures recently       completed and the average amounts recovered (including related recovery costs) from these       completed procedures.	0

Credit institutions should carefully monitor cases where the debt is swapped with an asset       or equity of the borrower, at least by using volume indicators by type of assets, and ensure       compliance with any limits set by the relevant national regulations on holdings. The use of       this approach as a forbearance measure should be backed by a proper business plan and       limited to assets in relation to which the institution has sufficient expertise and the market       realistically allows the determined value to be extracted from the asset in the short to       medium term. The institution should also make sure that the valuation of the assets is carried       out by qualified and experienced appraisers.	   123. Credit institutions should monitor and report to their management bodies the amount of       interest income stemming from NPEs. In addition, a distinction should be made between the       interest payments on NPEs actually received and those not actually received. The evolution       of loss allowances and the related drivers should also be monitored.	0

If foreclosure is a part of a credit institution’s NPE strategy, it should also monitor the       volume, ageing, coverage and flows of foreclosed assets (or other assets stemming from       NPEs) at a sufficient level of granularity to take into account material types of assets. The       performance of the foreclosed assets vis-a-vis the predefined business plan should be       monitored and reported to the management body and other relevant managers on an       aggregate level.	125. Credit institutions should use the definitions of forbearance measures and FBEs as stated          in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 in their risk          management. Forbearance measures should aim to return the borrower to a sustainable          performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and minimising expected          losses. When deciding on which steps or forbearance measures to take, credit institutions          should take into account the interests of consumers and comply with consumer protection          requirements, including those set out in Article 28 of Directive 2014/17/EU32 and in the EBA          Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure.33 Credit institutions should monitor the efficiency and          effectiveness of forbearance activities.	0

Credit institutions should consider using a combination of different forbearance measures,          including both short-term and long-term time horizons in line with the nature and maturity          of the credit facilities. Credit institutions should consider the list of possible forbearance          measures in Annex 5.	      128. Credit institutions should use forbearance measures with time horizons shorter than two          years (one year in the case of project finance and the construction of commercial property)          where such measures do not address the resolution of outstanding arrears, unless such          measures are combined with forbearance measures that are longer than two years.	0
10-guideline.txt	   136. Credit institutions should monitor the quality of forbearance activities to make sure that       they are not used to delay an assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring       should cover forbearance activities relating to both performing and non-performing       exposures and differentiate between types of forbearance measures and portfolios.	   137. Credit institutions should measure the efficiency of the process for granting forbearance       measures and monitor the duration of the decision-making process and the volumes of       forbearance measures at each stage of the granting process.	0
10-guideline.txt	   138. Credit institutions should monitor effectiveness of forbearance measures granted. This       monitoring should measure the degree of success of the forbearance measure and whether       the modified contractual obligations of the borrower are met and the exposure is       performing. The following metrics by portfolio and by type of forbearance measure should       be used:	   139. Credit institutions should monitor indicators relating to forbearance activities using a       meaningful breakdown, which could include the type and duration of arrears, the type of       exposure, the probability of recovery, the size of the exposures or the total amount of       exposures to the same borrower or group of connected clients, and the number of       forbearance solutions applied in the past.	0
10-guideline.txt	   140. Before granting any forbearance measures, credit institutions should assess the borrower’s       repayment capacity. This should include an adequate assessment of the borrower’s financial       situation, based on sufficient information and taking into account relevant factors such as       the debt-servicing capacity and overall indebtedness of the borrower or the       property/project.	   141. Credit institutions should have adequate policies and procedures in place with a range of       sustainable and effective solutions for the borrower when granting forbearance. The       grouping of exposures into portfolios should be reflected in these policies and procedures,       to enable credit institutions to adopt different forbearance measures for different segments       of borrowers and tailor measures to them.	0
10-guideline.txt	   142. Credit institutions should consider developing decision trees and standardised forbearance       measures for portfolios of homogeneous borrowers with less complex exposures.

These milestones/targets should be credible,         be appropriately conservative and take account of any potential deterioration in the         borrower’s financial situation. The performance of the forborne borrower, including the         borrower’s compliance with all agreed targets, should be closely monitored by the NPE WU         responsible for granting the forbearance, at least for the duration of the probation period.	7.

Credit institutions should reclassify NPEs, including FBEs, as performing in accordance with       Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014. Credit institutions       should perform a financial analysis of the borrower to establish the absence of concerns       regarding the borrower’s ability to pay its credit obligations.	0
10-guideline.txt	   158. Credit institutions’ policies for the reclassification of non-performing FBEs should specify       practices for dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to comply with the postforbearance conditions set out in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)       No 680/2014. These policies should establish criteria in terms of payments made during the       cure period of at least one year and define the borrower’s ability to comply with postforbearance conditions (to the extent that full repayment of the debt is likely) without being       reliant on the realisation of collateral at least by demonstrating payments of a not       insignificant amount of principal. These policies should require payments of both principal       and interest.	   159. In addition, where a borrower has other exposures to a credit institution that are not the       subject of a forbearance measure, the credit institution should consider the impact and the       performance of these exposures in its assessment of the borrower’s ability to comply with       post-forbearance conditions. The consideration of arrears should not change the level of       application of non-performing status, in accordance with Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, and only exposures to which forbearance       measures have been applied should be identified as FBEs.	0
10-guideline.txt	   160. The existence of contract terms that extend the repayment period, such as grace periods       for the principal, should confirm the classification of these FBEs as non-performing until the       requirements of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have       been satisfied. The fact that the one-year cure period has elapsed should not automatically       lead to reclassification to performing unless regular payments have been made over these	   161. Once FBEs are classified as performing, either because they have met the conditions for       being reclassified from the non-performing category or because the granting of forbearance       measures did not lead to the classification of the exposure as non-performing, they should       continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions for the discontinuation of the       classification of exposures as forborne under paragraph 256 of Annex V to Commission       Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have been met.	0
10-guideline.txt	      165.

Credit institutions’          policies should also ensure a consistent assessment of the underlying legal relationships          between legal entities across a group of connected clients. In view of possible contagion,          credit institutions should, whenever feasible, apply a group perspective when assessing the          status of a borrower’s exposure as non-performing, unless it is affected by isolated disputes          that are unrelated to the solvency of the counterparty.	174. Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to sound policies, procedures and          controls for assessing and measuring loss allowances and write-off on NPEs in accordance          with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected          credit losses.

Competent authorities should bear in mind that more than one fee or type of fee might relate to the same service within their Member State. Each fee does not need to be considered as a separate service. Competent authorities should take into consideration that different PSPs may have different fee structures for the same service. Therefore, when determining which services to consider including on their list, competent authorities should first consider what the provided ‘service’ is.	0

For prudential purposes, credit institutions should update valuations of all secured       exposures in accordance with the requirements of Article 208(3) and Article 210(c) of       Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.	Many services may be delivered through different channels. For instance, certain payment transactions might incur different fees depending on whether they are made online, by telephone or in branch. As the pricing differentiation might be particularly pertinent to customers if the costs vary significantly between channels, competent authorities are asked to indicate this in the template. Subsequently, a fee, even if the charge differs depending on the channel used, should be considered as one in the list of 10–20 fees; PSPs will still be able to disclose the range of fees for that one service in the FID. It is recognised however that the facility to use a particular channel might in itself constitute the service (e.g. if a customer is charged a fee to be able to use telephone banking).	0
10-guideline.txt	   198. The group of collaterals that are subject to individual valuations and revaluations on a       regular basis should be updated at the time when the exposure is classified as nonperforming and at least annually while it continues to be classified as such. Credit institutions       should make sure that, for the collateral subject to indexation or other similar methods, the       indexation is updated at least annually.	Regular ‘maintenance’ fees on a payment account might cover a range of payment services (e.g. ATM withdrawals, in-branch transactions). In some cases, the use of such services might be restricted, such as by the number of transactions permitted. Additional transactions might or might not attract a separate, additional fee. Competent authorities may therefore consider that it is appropriate, according to the criteria, to include separately in their provisional list the services covered by the maintenance fee if within that Member State they are liable to attract a fee. Competent authorities should note that in making this determination, Article 4(3) of the Directive requires the services included in packages of this type and any such additional fees to be disclosed in the FID.	0

For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (c) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account both the character and     materiality of the loss related to the sale of credit obligations, in accordance with the     following paragraphs. Transactions of traditional securitisation with significant risk transfer     and any intragroup sales of credit obligations should be considered sale of credit obligations.	45. In order to assess the materiality of the overall economic loss related with the sale of credit     obligations, institutions should calculate the economic loss and compare it to the threshold     referred to in paragraph 44. Where the economic loss is higher than this threshold they     should consider the credit obligations defaulted.	0
15-guideline.txt	42. Institutions should analyse the reasons for the sale of credit obligations and the reasons for     any losses recognised thereby. Where the reasons for the sale of credit obligations were not     related to credit risk, such as where there is the need to increase the liquidity of the     institution or there is a change in business strategy, and the institution does not perceive the     credit quality of those obligations as declined, the economic loss related with the sale of     those obligations should be considered not credit-related. In that case the sale should not be     considered an indication of default even where the loss is material, on condition of the     appropriate, documented justification of the treatment of the sale loss as not credit-related.     Institutions may, in particular, consider the loss on the sale of credit obligations as non-credit     related where the assets subject to the sale are publicly traded assets and measured at fair     value.	46. The sale of credit obligations may be performed either before or after the default. In the case     of institutions that use the IRB Approach, regardless of the moment of the sale, if the sale was     related with a material credit-related economic loss, the information about the loss should be     adequately recorded and stored for the purpose of the estimation of risk parameters.	0

If the sale of a credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss occurred before the     identification of default on that exposure, the moment of sale should be considered the     moment of default. In the case of a partial sale of the total obligations of an obligor where the     sale is associated to a material credit-related economic loss, all the remaining exposures to     this obligor should be treated as defaulted, unless the exposures are eligible as retail     exposures and the institution applies the default definition at facility level.	0
15-guideline.txt	43. Where, however, the loss on the sale of credit obligations is related to the credit quality of     the obligations themselves, in particular where the institution sells the credit obligations due     to the decrease in their quality, the institution should analyse the materiality of the economic     loss and, where the economic loss is material, this should be considered an indication of     default.	48. In the case of a sale of a portfolio of exposures the treatment of individual credit obligations     within this portfolio should be determined in accordance with the manner the price for the     portfolio was set. Where the price for the total portfolio was determined by specifying the     discount on particular credit obligations, the materiality of credit-related economic loss     should be assessed individually for each exposure within the portfolio. Where however the     price was set only at the portfolio level, the materiality of credit-related economic loss may be     assessed at the portfolio level and in that case, if the threshold specified in paragraph 44 is	0

Given that, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the     obligor should be considered defaulted where the distressed restructuring is likely to result in     a diminished financial obligation, where considering forborne exposures, the obligor should     be classified as defaulted only where the relevant forbearance measures are likely to result in     a diminished financial obligation.	55. Where any of the modifications of the schedule of credit obligations referred to in point (e) of     Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is the result of financial difficulties of an     obligor, institutions should also assess whether a distressed restructuring has taken place and     whether an indication of unlikeliness to pay has occurred.	0

Institutions should set a threshold for the diminished financial obligation that is considered to     be caused by material forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees, and which     should be calculated according to the following formula, and should not be higher than 1%:	56. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should clearly specify in their internal policies what     type of arrangement is treated as an order or as a protection similar to bankruptcy, taking     into account all relevant legal frameworks as well as the following typical characteristics of     such protection:	0
15-guideline.txt	82. Further, where the identification of default of an obligor in a manner fully consistent across     the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries is very burdensome, requiring     development of a centralised database of all clients or implementation of other mechanisms     or procedures to verify the status of each client at all entities within the group, institutions    	 need not apply such mechanisms or procedures if they can demonstrate that the effect of     non-compliance is immaterial because there are no or very limited number of common clients     among the relevant entities within a group and the exposure to these clients is immaterial.	
15-guideline.txt	83. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 79, an institution, parent undertaking or any of its     subsidiaries should use the same definition of default for a single type of exposures as defined     in point (2) of Article 142(1) pf Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. They may use different     definitions of default for different types of exposures, including for certain legal entities or for    	 presence in geographical locations in ways other than via a legal entity, where this is justified     by the application of significantly different internal risk management practices or by different     legal requirements applying in different jurisdictions, in particular by reasons such as:

15-guideline.txt	88. Institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an obligor for some types of     retail exposures and at the level of a credit facility for others, where this is well justified by     internal risk management practices, for instance due to a different business model of a    	 subsidiary, and where there is evidence that the number of situations where the same clients     are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application is kept to a strict     minimum.	
15-guideline.txt	89. Where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for     different types of retail exposures, according to paragraph 88, they should ensure that the     scope of application of each definition of default is clearly specified and that it is used     	consistently over time for different types of retail exposures. In the case of institutions that     use the IRB Approach the risk estimates should correctly reflect the definition of default     applied to each type of exposures.	
15-guideline.txt	90. Where institutions use different levels of application of the default definition with regard to     certain retail portfolios,	 the treatment of common clients across such portfolios should be     specified in their internal policies and procedures. In particular, where the exposure to which	
15-guideline.txt	    the definition of default at the obligor level applies fulfils either or both of the conditions of     points (a) or (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, then all exposures to that     obligor should be considered defaulted, including those subject to the application of the     definition of default at individual credit facility level. Where the exposure subject to the     application of the 	definition of default at individual credit facility level meets those     conditions, the other exposures to the obligor should not be automatically reclassified to     default status. Institutions, however, may classify those other exposures as defaulted on the     basis of other unlikeliness to pay considerations, as provided further in paragraphs 92 to 94.	
15-guideline.txt	91. The same rule should apply to the obligors treated under the Standardised Approach, where     some exposures to an obligor fulfil the requirements of Article 123 of Regulation (EU)     575/2013 while other exposures to the same obligor are in the form of securities and     therefore do not qualify as retail. Where an exposure in the form of a security fulfils either or     both of the conditions of points (a) or (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all     exposures to that 	obligor should be considered defaulted. Where the exposure that fulfils the     requirements of Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 meets those conditions and the     institution applies the definition of default at the individual credit facility level, the other     exposures to the obligor should not be automatically reclassified to default status.

Where, in accordance with the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013, the definition of default has been applied at the level of an individual credit facility     with regard to retail exposures, institutions should not consider automatically the different     exposures to the same obligor defaulted at the same time. Nevertheless institutions should    	 take into account that some indications of default are related with the condition of the     obligor rather than the status of a particular exposure. This refers in particular to the     indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the bankruptcy of the obligor as specified in     points (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where such indication of     default occurs, institutions should treat all exposures to the same obligor as defaulted     regardless of the level of application of the definition of default.	
15-guideline.txt	93. Institutions should consider also other indications of unlikeliness to pay and specify, in line     with their internal policies 	and procedures, which indications of unlikeliness to pay reflect the     overall situation of an obligor rather than that of the exposure. Where such other indications     of unlikeliness to pay occur, all exposures to the obligor should be considered defaulted     regardless of the level of application of the definition of default.	
15-guideline.txt	94. Additionally, where a significant part of the exposures to 	the obligor is in default, institutions     may consider it unlikely that the other obligations of that obligor will be paid in full without     recourse to actions such as realising security and treat them as defaulted as well.	
15-guideline.txt	100.    Institutions should identify, on the basis of the analysis of relevant legal provisions in a    jurisdiction, and provide in their internal policies and procedures for the identification of the    obligors that are legally fully liable for certain obligations jointly and severally with other    obligors, therefore being fully liable for the entire amount of those obligations, but excluding    credit obligations of an individual obligor secured by another individual or entity in the form    of a guarantee	 or other credit protection. A typical example would be a married couple    where, based on specific legal provisions applicable in the relevant jurisdiction, division of    marital property (system of separate estates) does not apply. In the case of full mutual    liability for all obligations, default of one of such obligors should be considered an indication    of potential unlikeliness to pay of the other obligor and therefore institutions should assess    whether the individual and joint credit obligations of these obligors should be considered    defaulted. Where one of the joint and several obligors that are legally fully liable for all    obligations, has a joint credit obligation with another client, the institution should assess    whether indications of unlikeliness to pay occur also on the other joint credit obligations with    third parties.	
15-guideline.txt	101.   Institutions should also analyse the forms of legal entities in relevant jurisdictions and the    extent of liability of the owners, partners, shareholders or managers for the obligations of a    company depending on the legal form of the entity. Where an individual is fully liable for the    obligations of a company, default of that company should result in that individual being    considered defaulted as well. Where such full liability for the obligations of a company does   	 not exist, owners, partners or significant shareholders of a defaulted company should be    assessed by the institution for possible indications of unlikeliness to pay with regard to their    individual obligations.	
15-guideline.txt	102.    Additionally, in the specific case of an individual entrepreneur where an individual is fully    liable for both private and commercial obligations with both private and 	commercial assets    the default of any of the private or commercial obligations should cause all private and    commercial obligations of such individual to be considered as defaulted as well.	
15-guideline.txt	103.   Where the definition of default is applied at the level of an obligor for retail exposures,    the materiality threshold 	should also be applied at the level of an obligor. Institutions should    clearly specify in their internal policies and procedures the treatment of joint credit    obligations in the application of the materiality threshold.	
15-guideline.txt	104.   A joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that have 	a joint obligation towards    an institution, should be treated as a different obligor from each of the individual obligors. In    the case the delay in payment occurs on a joint credit obligation, the materiality of such delay    should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of Article    178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all joint credit obligations granted to this specific    set of obligors. For this purpose the individual exposures to obligors participating in a joint	
15-guideline.txt	105.   When delay in payment occurs on an individual credit obligation, the materiality of such    delay should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of    Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all individual credit obligations of this    obligor, without taking into account any joint credit obligations of that obligor with other    individuals or ent	ities. Where the materiality threshold calculated in this way is breached, all    individual exposures to this obligor should be considered defaulted.	
15-guideline.txt	110.  For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 109, institutions should document the    application of the definition of default in a detailed manner by including the    operation	alization of all indications of default, including the process, sources of information    and responsibilities for the identification of particular indications of default.	
15-guideline.txt	111.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 109, institutions should document the    operationalization of the criteria for reclassification of a defaulted obligor to a non-defaulted    status, inc	luding the processes, sources of information and responsibilities assigned to    relevant personnel.	
15-guideline.txt	112.   For the purposes of paragraphs 110 and 111, the documentation should include    description of all autom	atic mechanisms and manual processes, and where qualitative    indications of default or criteria for the return to non-defaulted status are applied manually    the description should be sufficiently detailed to facilitate common understanding and    consistent application by all responsible personnel.	
15-guideline.txt	113.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 109, institutions should keep an updated    register of all current and past vers	ions of the default definition at least starting from the date    of application of these guidelines. This register should include at least the following    information:	
15-guideline.txt	The primary problem that the GL aim to address is the potential lack of common practice and variations in the application of the definition of default. Significant variations have been observed in particular in such areas as counting of days past due, assessment of indications of	 unlikeliness to pay, criteria for reclassification of an obligor from default to non-defaulted status and the use of technical defaults. The lack of a common and consistent application of the definition of default may further lead to incomparability of IRB risk parameters and own funds requirements under both the IRB Approach and the Standardised Approach. This situation would create an uneven playing field across Member States and institutions.	
15-guideline.txt	The objective of the GL is to establish convergence of institutions’ practices and supervisory practices regarding the application of the definition of default. The GL are complementary to the RTS on the materiality threshold for credit obligations past due under Article 178(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (RTS on the materiality threshold) and specify indications	 and criteria for the application of the definition of default. Harmonisation of the current practices, which vary across Member States and institutions, is expected to enhance comparability of own funds and own funds requirements and to reduce the burden for cross-border institutions of complying with different regulatory frameworks.	
15-guideline.txt	The EBA conducted a qualitative and quantitative impact study (QIS) to assess the impact of the regulatory proposals to harmonise the definition of default propos	ed in consultation papers on the GL and the RTS on the materiality threshold. A total of 72 institutions participated in the study. Detailed results of the QIS are presented in a report on the results of the data collection exercise on the proposed regulatory changes for a common EU approach to the definition of default (QIS report) published alongside these GL on the EBA website.	
15-guideline.txt	The QIS contains two parts: a qualitative questionnaire to gather information on institutions’ current practices and a quantitative survey aimed at quantifying the impact of the proposed technical options around the definition of default. The baseline information from the qualitative questionnaire is the benchmark for assessing the potential costs and benefits that European institutions will be subject to under the technical options.	 In other words, if the current practices of the institutions are the same as or similar to the elements that are specified in the GL, the expected costs will be lower than if the current practices are very different from the practices resulting from the policy decisions taken under the GL.	
15-guideline.txt	The results of the QIS confirm that substantial variability exists in the approaches taken across institutions in most	 of the areas related to the definition of default. The quantitative part of the report reinforces the conclusion that differences in the definitions of default used by institutions appear to be a driver of RWA variability.	
15-guideline.txt	Section 2 of the QIS report presents an overview of the current practices across institutions in relation to the technical options considered in the consultation paper on the GL.	 Below, the current practices observed for each technical option are compared with the provisions specified in the GL.	
15-guideline.txt	Section 2.2 of the QIS report shows that more than half of the institutions apply a single default definition across the group;	 in the other institutions, the main reasons behind the use of various default definitions, in line with paragraph 83 of the GL, may stem from different materiality thresholds or different counting of days past due for retail and non-retail exposures.	
15-guideline.txt	Section 2.3 of the QIS report shows that institutions are heterogeneous in their application of the definition of default for retail exposures. Institutions are split between those which apply the definition of default at the obligor level and those which apply the definition of default at the facility level or at both the facility and the obligor level. The choice in that regard is granted by Article 178(1) of the CRR.	 Also, the use of different levels of application of the definition of default for certain retail portfolios, under certain conditions, is in line with the requirements included in the GL. Among those institutions applying the definition of default at the facility level almost three quarters do not apply the pulling effect for the purpose of default identification, but the GL also leave it to institutions to assess whether the application of the pulling effect is appropriate and include it only as an optional indication of unlikeness to pay. The QIS results show, moreover, a heterogeneous use of contagion rules where the definition of default is applied at the obligor

These guidelines apply in relation to those credit institutions’ credit risk management    practices affecting the assessment of credit risk and measurement of expected credit losses    from lending exposures and allowances under the applicable accounting framework.	 These    guidelines also apply when, where permitted by the applicable accounting framework, the    carrying amount of the lending exposure is reduced directly without the use of an allowance    account. These guidelines do not set out any additional requirements regarding the    determination of expected loss for regulatory capital purposes.	
18-guideline.txt	8. These guidelines build on Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU 16 which states that institutions    must have adequate internal control mechanisms, including sound administration and	    accounting procedures that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk    management; and Article 79(b) and (c) of that Directive, which states that competent    authorities must ensure that institutions have internal methodologies that enable them to    assess the credit risk of exposures to individual obligors and at the portfolio level, and    effective systems for the ongoing administration and monitoring of the various credit riskbearing portfolios and exposures, including for identifying and managing problem credits and    for making adequate value adjustments and provisions, respectively. In addition,    Article 88(1)(b) of Directive 2013/36/EU states the principle that ‘the management body must    ensure the integrity of the accounting and financial reporting systems, including financial and    operational controls and compliance with the law and relevant standards’.

18-guideline.txt	17. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a manner that is appropriate to     their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities	     and portfolios, and, more generally, all other relevant facts and circumstances of the credit     institution (and the group (if any) to which it belongs). The use of properly designed     proportionate approaches should not jeopardise the high-quality implementation of the ECL     accounting frameworks.	
18-guideline.txt	18. Credit institutions should also give due consideration to the application of the principle of     materiality. However, this should not result in individual exposures or portfolios being	     considered immaterial if, cumulatively, these represent a material exposure to the credit     institution. In addition, materiality should not be assessed only on the basis of the potential     impact on the profit or loss statement at the reporting date. For instance, large portfolio(s) of     lending exposures such as real estate mortgages would generally be considered material even     if they are highly collateralised.	
18-guideline.txt	19. In considering how to take proportionality or materiality into account 	in the design of an ECL     methodology or in its implementation, it is important to ensure that bias is not being     introduced.

The timely recognition of credit deterioration and allowances should not be delayed without     prejudice to the fact that ECL accounting frameworks are symmetrical in the way that	     subsequent changes (both deteriorations and reversals of those deteriorations) in the credit     risk profile of a debtor should be considered in the measurement of the allowances.

Information which is ultimately included in the assessment of credit risk and     measurement of ECL should also be reasonable and supportable. Credit institutions should     use their experienced credit judgement in determining the range of relevant information that	
18-guideline.txt	22. In order to ensure a timely recognition of credit losses, credit institutions should consider     forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. When considering forwardlooking information, credit institutions should apply sound judgement consistent with	     generally accepted methods for economic analysis and forecasting, and supported by a     sufficient set of data.	
18-guideline.txt	23. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate how they have considered relevant, 	    reasonable and supportable information in the ECL assessment and measurement process.     Credit institutions should apply experienced credit judgement in the consideration of future     scenarios and take into account the potential consequence of events occurring or not     occurring, and the resulting impact on the measurement of ECL. Information should not be     excluded from that process simply because an event has a low likelihood of occurring or the     effect of that event on the credit risk or the amount of expected credit losses is uncertain. In     certain circumstances information relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk     may not be reasonable and supportable and should therefore be excluded from the ECL     assessment and measurement process. Given that these circumstances would be exceptional     in nature, credit institutions should provide a clearly documented, robust justification.	
18-guideline.txt	24. The information used shall include an unbiased consideration of relevant factors and their     impact on creditworthiness and cash shortfalls. Relevant factors include those intrinsic to the 	    bank and its business or derived from external conditions.	
18-guideline.txt	4.2 Principles on credit risk 	management practices and accounting for expected credit losses	
18-guideline.txt	4.2.1        Principle 1 —	 Management body and senior management responsibilities	
18-guideline.txt	The management body 21 and senior management of a credit institution are responsible for ensuring that the credit institution has appropriate credit risk management practices,	 including an effective internal control system, to consistently determine adequate allowances in accordance with the credit institution’s stated policies and procedures, the applicable accounting framework and relevant supervisory guidance.	
18-guideline.txt	21    Various management body structures can be observed in EU Member States. In some Member States a single-tier structure	 is common, i.e. supervisory and management functions of the management body are exercised within a single body. In other Member States a two-tier structure is common, with two independent bodies being established, one for the management function and the other for the supervision of the management function.	
18-guideline.txt	25. The credit institution’s management body should be responsible for approving and regularly     reviewing a credit institution’s credit risk management strategy and the main policies and 	    processes for identifying, measuring, evaluating, monitoring, reporting and mitigating credit     risk consistent with the approved risk appetite set by the management body. In addition, to     limit the risk that lending exposures pose to depositors and, more generally, financial stability,     a credit institution’s management body should require that senior management adopt and     adhere to sound underwriting practices 22.	
18-guideline.txt	26. To fulfil these responsibilities,	 the management body should instruct senior management to:	
18-guideline.txt	a. develop and maintain appropriate processes, which should be systemati	c and consistently    applied, to determine appropriate allowances in accordance with the applicable accounting    framework;	
18-guideline.txt	b. establish and implement an effective internal control system for credit risk assessment and    measurement; re	port periodically the results of the credit risk assessment and measurement    processes, including estimates of its ECL allowances;	
18-guideline.txt	c. establish, implement and, as necessary, update suitable policies and procedures to    communicate the credit risk assessment	 and measurement process internally to all relevant    staff, in particular staff members who are involved in that process.	
18-guideline.txt	28. The credit risk assessment and measurement process should provide the relevant information     for senior management to make its experienced judgements about the credit risk of lending     exposures, and the related estimation of ECL.	29. Credit institutions should, to the maximum extent possible, leverage and integrate common     processes, systems, tools and data that are used within a credit institution to determine if,     when, and on what terms, credit should be granted; monitor credit risk; and measure     allowances for both accounting and capital adequacy purposes.	
18-guideline.txt	30. A credit institution’s allowance methodologies should clearly document the definitions of key     terms related to the assessment of credit risk and ECL measurement (such as loss and     migration rates, loss events and default). Where different terms, information or assumptions     are used across functional areas (such as accounting, capital adequacy and credit risk     management), the underlying rationale for these differences should be documented and     approved by senior management. Information and assumptions used for ECL estimates should     be reviewed and updated as required by the applicable accounting framework.	31. Credit institutions should have in place adequate processes and systems to appropriately     identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and mitigate the level of credit risk. During the     transition to the ECL accounting model, existing processes and systems should be evaluated     and, if necessary, modified to collect and analyse relevant information affecting the     assessment of credit risk and ECL measurement.	
18-guideline.txt	32. Credit institutions should adopt and adhere to written policies and procedures detailing the     credit risk systems and controls used in their credit risk methodologies, and the separate roles     and responsibilities of the credit institution’s management body and senior management.	33. Sound methodologies for assessing credit risk and measuring the level of allowances (subject     to exposure type, for example retail or wholesale) should, in particular:	
18-guideline.txt	34. A credit institution’s credit risk identification process should ensure that factors that impact     changes in credit risk and estimates of ECL are properly identified on a regular basis. In     addition, consideration of credit risk inherent in new products and activities should be a key     part of the credit risk identification process, the assessment of credit risk and measurement     of ECL.	35. Senior management should consider relevant facts and circumstances, including forwardlooking information, that are likely to cause ECL to differ from historical experience and that     may affect credit risk and the full collectability of cash flows.	
18-guideline.txt	42. As part of its credit risk assessment process, credit institutions should have in place     comprehensive procedures and information systems to monitor the quality of their lending     exposures. These include an effective credit risk rating process that captures the varying level,     nature and drivers of credit risk that may manifest themselves over time, in order to     reasonably ensure that all lending exposures are properly monitored and that ECL allowances     are appropriately measured.	54. Credit institutions should use temporary adjustments to an allowance only as an interim     solution, in particular in transient circumstances or when there is insufficient time to     appropriately incorporate relevant new information into the existing credit risk rating and     modelling process, or to re-segment existing groups of lending exposures, or when lending     exposures within a group of lending exposures react to factors or events differently than     initially expected.	
18-guideline.txt	43. The credit risk rating process should include an independent review function. Initial     assignment of credit risk grades to exposures and their ongoing updating by front-line lending     staff should be subject to the review of the independent review function.	                                                                                                   29 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	
18-guideline.txt	44. Credit institutions should take into account a number of criteria when assigning the credit risk     grade upon initial recognition of a lending exposure including, to the extent relevant, product     type, terms and conditions, collateral type and amount, borrower characteristics and     geography or a combination thereof.	55. Such adjustments should not be continuously used over the long term for a non-transient risk     factor. If the reason for the adjustment is not expected to be temporary, such as the     emergence of a new risk driver that has not previously been incorporated into the     institution’s allowance methodology, the methodology should be updated in the near term to     incorporate the factor that is expected to have an ongoing impact on the measurement of     ECL.	
18-guideline.txt	45. When changing existing credit risk grades assigned, on either a portfolio or an individual basis,     credit institutions should take into account other relevant factors such as, but not limited to,     changes in industry outlook, business growth rates, consumer sentiment and changes in     economic forecasts (such as interest rates, unemployment rates and commodity prices) as     well as weaknesses in underwriting identified after initial recognition.	56. The use of temporary adjustments requires the application of significant judgement and     creates the potential for bias. In order to avoid the creation of potential for bias, temporary     adjustments should be directionally consistent with forward-looking forecasts, supported by     appropriate documentation, and subject to appropriate governance processes.	
18-guideline.txt	46. The credit risk rating system should capture all lending exposures when assessing the impact     of changes in credit risk, and not only those that may have experienced significant increases     in credit risk, have incurred losses or are otherwise credit impaired. This is to allow for an     appropriate differentiation of credit risk and grouping of lending exposures within the credit     risk rating system, and to reflect the risk of individual exposures as well as, when aggregated     across all exposures, the level of credit risk in the portfolio as a whole. In this context, an     effective credit risk rating system should allow credit institutions to identify both migration of     credit risk and significant changes in credit risk.	   4.2.4          Principle 4 — Adequacy of the allowance	
18-guideline.txt	47. Credit institutions should describe the elements of their credit risk rating system, clearly     defining each credit risk grade and designating the staff responsible for the design,     implementation, operation and performance of the system as well as those responsible for     periodic testing and validation (i.e. the independent review function).	   A credit institution’s aggregate amount of allowances, regardless of whether allowances are    determined on a collective or an individual basis, should be adequate and consistent with the    objectives of the applicable accounting framework.	
18-guideline.txt	57. Credit institutions should implement sound credit risk methodologies with the objective that     the overall balance of the allowance for ECL is developed in accordance with the applicable     accounting framework and adequately reflects ECL within that framework.	61. Regardless of the assessment approach it uses (individual or collective), a credit institution     should ensure this does not result in delayed recognition of ECL.	
18-guideline.txt	58. When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account     relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date that may affect the collectability of     remaining cash flows over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending     exposure. Credit institutions should consider information which goes beyond historical and     current data, and take into account reasonable and supportable forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors, that are relevant to the exposure(s) being evaluated (for     example retail or wholesale) in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.	62. When credit institutions use individual assessments, the ECL estimate should always     incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking     information, including macroeconomic factors, that affect collectability and credit risk. When     applying an individual assessment approach, in the same manner as in the case of collective     assessment, the credit institution’s documentation should clearly demonstrate how forwardlooking information, including macroeconomic factors, has been reflected in the individual     assessment.	
18-guideline.txt	59. Depending on the ability to incorporate forward-looking information into the ECL estimate,     credit institutions may use individual or collective assessment approaches; regardless of the     assessment approach used, they should be consistent with the relevant accounting     requirements and not result in materially different allowance measurements. Together,     individual and collective assessments form the basis for the allowance for ECL.	63. In cases when a credit institution’s individual assessments of exposures do not adequately     consider forward-looking information, and in order to allow identification of relationships     between forward-looking information and ECL estimates that may not be apparent at the     individual level, an institution should group lending exposures with shared credit risk     characteristics to estimate the impact of forward-looking information, including     macroeconomic factors. Conversely, when credit institutions determine that all reasonable     and supportable forward-looking information has been incorporated in the individual     assessment of ECL, an additional forward-looking assessment should not be conducted on a     collective basis if that could result in double counting.	
18-guideline.txt	60. The ECL assessment approach used should be the most appropriate in the particular     circumstances, and typically should be aligned with how the credit institution manages the     lending exposure. For example, collective assessment is often used for large groups of     homogeneous lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics, such as retail     portfolios. Individual assessments are often conducted for significant exposures, or where     credit concerns have been identified at the individual loan level, such as watch list and past     due loans.	64. Credit institutions may use in the ECL assessment and measurement process models and     assumption-based estimates for risk identification and measurement, at both the individual     lending exposure and overall portfolio levels, including credit grading, credit risk     identification, measurement of ECL allowances for accounting purposes, stress testing and     capital allocation. Models used in the ECL assessment and measurement process should     consider the impact of changes to borrower and credit risk-related variables such as changes     in PDs, LGDs, exposure amounts, collateral values, migration of default probabilities and     internal borrower credit risk grades based on historical, current, and reasonable and     supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors.	
18-guideline.txt	65. Credit institutions should have robust policies and procedures in place to appropriately     validate the accuracy and consistency of the models used to assess the credit risk and     measure ECL, including their model-based credit risk rating systems and processes and the     estimation of all relevant risk components, at the outset of model usage and on an ongoing     basis. Such policies and procedures should appropriately include the role of professional     judgement.	   4.2.7          Principle 7 — Common processes, systems, tools and data	
18-guideline.txt	                                                                                               31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	   Credit institutions should have a sound credit risk assessment and measurement process that    provides them with a strong basis for common processes, systems, tools and data to assess    credit risk and to account for expected credit losses.	
18-guideline.txt	66. Model validation should be conducted when the ECL models are initially developed and when     significant changes are made to the models, and should ensure that the models are suitable     for their proposed usage on an ongoing basis.	75. To the maximum extent possible, credit institutions should use common processes, systems,     tools and data to assess credit risk, measure ECL for accounting purposes and determine     expected losses for capital adequacy purposes in order to strengthen the reliability and     consistency of the resulting ECL estimates, increase transparency and, through market     discipline, provide incentives to follow sound credit risk practices.	
18-guideline.txt	68. Credit institutions should have the necessary tools to ensure a robust estimate and timely     recognition of ECL. Given that information on historical loss experience or the impact of     current conditions may not fully reflect the credit risk in lending exposures, credit institutions     should use their experienced credit judgement to thoroughly incorporate the expected     impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including     macroeconomic factors, on its estimate of ECL. A credit institution’s use of its experienced     credit judgement should be documented in the credit institution’s credit risk methodology     and subject to appropriate oversight.	76. Credit risk practices should be reviewed periodically to ensure that relevant data available     throughout a credit institution’s organisation are captured and that systems are updated as     the credit institution’s underwriting or business practices change or evolve over time. A     feedback loop should be established to ensure that information on estimates of ECL, changes     in credit risk and actual losses experienced on lending exposures is shared among credit risk     experts, accounting and regulatory reporting staff, and in particular with the loan     underwriting staff.	
18-guideline.txt	69. Historical information provides a useful basis for the identification of trends and correlations     needed to identify the credit risk drivers for lending exposures. However, ECL estimates must     not ignore the impact of (forward-looking) events and conditions on those drivers. The     estimate should reflect the expected future cash shortfalls resulting from such impact.	77. The common processes, systems, tools and data mentioned above could include credit risk     rating systems, estimated PDs (subject to appropriate adjustments), past-due status, loan-tovalue ratios, historical loss rates, product type, amortisation schedule, down payment     requirements, market segment, geographical location, vintage (i.e. date of origination) and     collateral type.	
18-guideline.txt	70. Consideration of forward-looking information should not be avoided on the basis that a credit     institution considers the cost of incorporating such forward-looking information to be very     high or unnecessary or because there is uncertainty in formulating forward-looking scenarios,     unless the additional cost and operational burden to be introduced do not contribute to a     high-quality implementation of an ECL accounting framework.	78. The objective of public disclosures is to provide decision-useful information on a credit     institution’s financial position and performance, and changes therein, to a wide range of users     in a clear and understandable manner. Credit institutions should aim to provide information     that is relevant and comparable so that users can make timely, informed decisions and are     able to evaluate the stewardship of management body and senior management.	
18-guideline.txt	71. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that the forward-looking information     factored into the ECL estimation process has a link to the credit risk drivers for particular     exposures or portfolios. Given that it may not be possible to demonstrate a strong link in     formal statistical terms between certain types of information, or even the information set as a     whole, and the credit risk drivers, credit institutions should use their experienced credit     judgement in establishing an appropriate level for the individual or collective allowance.     When a forward-looking factor that has been identified as relevant is not incorporated into     the individual or collective assessment, temporary adjustments may be necessary.	79. Financial and credit risk management disclosures should be made in accordance with the     applicable accounting and supervisory frameworks 26. Credit institutions should provide the     disclosures needed to fairly depict a credit institutions’s exposure to credit risk, including its     ECL estimates, and to provide relevant information on a credit institution’s underwriting     practices.	
18-guideline.txt	                                                                                                   33 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	80. Consistently with the applicable accounting standards and regulations, credit institutions’     senior management should apply judgement to determine the appropriate level of     aggregation and disaggregation of data disclosed, such that disclosures continue to meet     accounting requirements, and provide insights into a credit institution’s exposure to credit     risk and ECLs for users to perform individual institution analysis and relevant peer group     comparisons.	
18-guideline.txt	72. Macroeconomic forecasts and other relevant information should be applied consistently     across portfolios where the credit risk drivers of the portfolios are affected by these     forecasts/assumptions in the same way. Furthermore, when developing ECL estimates, credit     institutions should apply their experienced credit judgement to consider their point in the     credit cycle, which may differ across the jurisdictions in which they have lending exposures.	81. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures when taken as a whole should communicate to users     the main assumptions/inputs used to develop ECL estimates. Disclosures should highlight     policies and definitions that are integral to the estimation of ECL (such as a credit institution’s     basis for grouping lending exposures into portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics and     its definition of default 27), factors that cause changes in ECL estimates, and the manner in     which senior management’s experienced credit judgement has been incorporated. Disclosure     of significant policies should indicate how those policies have been implemented in the     specific context of the credit institution.	
18-guideline.txt	73. Credit institutions should exercise care when determining the level of ECL allowances to be     recognised for accounting purposes, to ensure that the resulting estimates are appropriate     (i.e. consistent with neutrality and neither understated nor overstated).	82. Credit institutions should provide qualitative disclosures on how forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors, has been incorporated into the ECL estimation process, in     accordance with the applicable accounting framework, in particular when the assessment is     carried out on an individual basis.	
18-guideline.txt	74. Additionally, credit institutions should avail themselves of a wide range of information     derived in the credit risk management process, including that of a forward-looking nature for     risk management and capital adequacy purposes, in developing their estimate of ECL.	83. Disclosures regarding the basis for grouping lending exposures should include information on     how senior management satisfies itself that lending exposures are appropriately grouped,     such that these groups continue to share credit risk characteristics.	
18-guideline.txt	84. To improve the quality and meaningfulness of information disclosed for ECL estimates, credit     institutions should provide an explanation of significant changes to the estimation of ECL from	89. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37, does not define default, but requires credit institutions to define     default in a manner consistent with that used for internal credit risk management. IFRS 9,     paragraph B5.5.37, also includes a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later     than 90 days past due. When adopting a definition of default for accounting purposes, credit     institutions should be guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes provided in     Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 29, which includes both:	
18-guideline.txt	85. Credit institutions’ management body should regularly review its disclosure policies to ensure     that the information disclosed continues to be relevant to the credit institution’s risk profile,     product concentrations, industry norms and current market conditions. In doing so, credit     institutions should provide disclosures that facilitate comparisons with its peers, enabling     users to monitor changes in the credit institution’s ECL estimates from period to period and     perform meaningful analyses across national and international peer groups.	90. In accordance with Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, a default event shall be     considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either of the criteria in     paragraphs 4(a) and (b) is met, or both are met. In this context, credit institutions should     identify default, in accordance with the ’unlikeliness to pay’ criterion of the debtor, before the     exposure becomes delinquent with the 90-days-past-due criterion. In line with the approach     followed for regulatory purposes, the list of elements provided in Article 178(3) of Regulation     (EU) 575/2013 as indications of unlikeliness to pay should be implemented in a way that     ensures a timely detection of ‘unlikeliness to pay’ events that precipitate eventual cash     shortfalls. As regards the criterion in paragraph 4(b), although for regulatory purposes in the     case of retail and public sector entity obligations, for the 90-day figure competent authorities     may substitute a figure of up to 180 days for different products, as it considers appropriate to     local conditions (see Article 178(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013), this possibility should not     be read as an exemption from the application of the 90-day rebuttable presumption in IFRS 9,     paragraph B5.5.37, for those exposures.	
18-guideline.txt	4.3 Guidelines specific to credit institutions applying IFRS 9 This section provides guidelines on aspects of the ECL requirements in the impairment sections of IFRS 9 — (i) the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL; (ii) the assessment of significant increases in credit risk; and (iii) the use of practical expedients — that are not common to other ECL accounting frameworks and should be read in conjunction with the other sections of these guidelines.	91. In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should     consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in     Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit     judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the     credit institution’s assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to     undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12-     month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may     affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant     information that is reasonably available.	
18-guideline.txt	      4.3.1          Loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL	92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be     understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of ‘low credit risk’     exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially     measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for     significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime     ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit     greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.	
18-guideline.txt	86. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of IFRS 9, ’if, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a     financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall     measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month     expected credit losses’. Credit institutions should measure ECL for all lending exposures and a     nil allowance should be rare because ECL estimates are a probability-weighted amount that     should always reflect the possibility that a credit loss will occur (see paragraphs 5.5.17 and	93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should     adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have     taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either     individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any     migration of credit risk which has taken place.	
18-guideline.txt	5.5.18 of IFRS 9). A nil allowance could however occur, for example, for fully collateralised     loans (although credit institutions should be cautious when developing estimates of collateral     value, as valuation of collateral at origination may change over the life of the loan).	94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to     the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information     becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation     within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and     the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for     each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be     applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of     temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a     particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should     be recognised in respect of that subgroup.	
18-guideline.txt	87. Credit institutions should adopt an active approach to assessing and measuring 12-month ECL     that enables changes in credit risk to be identified in a timely manner and hence the timely     recognition of those changes in ECL. In accordance with Principle 6, estimates of the amount     and timing of 12-month ECL should reflect senior management’s experienced credit     judgement, and represent an unbiased probability-weighted estimate of ECL by considering a     range of possible outcomes	96. IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.4, states that ‘the objective of the impairment requirements is to     recognise lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments for which there have     been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition — whether assessed on an                                                                                                   38 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	
18-guideline.txt	88. IFRS 9 defines an amount equal to 12-month ECL as ‘the portion of lifetime expected credit     losses that represent the expected credit losses that result from default events on a financial     instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date’ 28. For these     purposes, credit institutions must note that an amount equal to the 12-month ECL is not only     the losses expected in the next 12 months; rather, in accordance with IFRS 9,	97. The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the     ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is taken into account in the pricing of credit at that     time. It follows, then, that a post-origination increase in credit risk may not be fully     compensated by the interest rate charged, and, as a consequence, credit institutions should     carefully consider whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk 30. If so, the     lending exposure should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.	
18-guideline.txt	98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and     the measurement of required 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, credit institutions should have     in place sound governance, systems and controls, in accordance with the principles specified     in these guidelines. Unless already established, credit institutions should implement systems     that are capable of handling and systematically assessing the large amounts of information     that will be required to judge whether or not particular lending exposures or groups of     lending exposures exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, and to measure lifetime ECL     where that is the case. Parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU     should ensure that the approach is consistent across the group. This should include, in     particular, putting in place processes to ensure that forecasts of economic conditions in     different jurisdictions and economic sectors are reviewed and approved by a credit     institution’s senior management, and that the process, controls and economic assumptions     around developing forecasts and linking these to expectations of credit loss are consistent     across the group. The need for consistency should not be interpreted as a requirement that     the practice be identical across a group. On the contrary, within a consistent framework there     may be differences across jurisdictions and products, depending for instance on the     availability of data. These differences should be well documented and justified.	121.   Credit institutions should rigorously review the quality of their approach to assessing    whether credit risk has increased significantly. A credit institution’s management body or    senior management should consider whether there are additional factors that should be    taken into account in the assessment of significant increases in credit risk which would    improve the quality of their approach.	
18-guideline.txt	99. Credit institutions’ processes in place should enable them to determine on a timely and     holistic basis whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk subsequent to the     initial recognition of a lending exposure so that an individual exposure, or a group of     exposures with similar credit risk characteristics, is transferred to lifetime ECL measurement     as soon as credit risk has increased significantly, in accordance with the IFRS 9 impairment     accounting requirements.	122.   Credit institutions should be alert to any possibility of bias being introduced that would    prevent the objectives of IFRS 9 from being met. In cases where credit institutions believe    that their approach to implementation is likely to have introduced bias, they should change    their assessment for identified bias and thus ensure that the objective of the Standard is met    (see in particular IFRS 9, paragraphs B5.5.1-B5.5.6).	
18-guideline.txt	100.   As noted in paragraph B5.5.17 of IFRS 9 on assessing significant increases in credit risk    since initial recognition, the range of information that will need to be considered in making    this determination is wide. In broad terms, it will include information on macroeconomic    conditions, and the economic sector and geographical region relevant to a particular    borrower or a group of borrowers with shared credit risk characteristics, in addition to    borrower-specific strategic, operational and other characteristics. A critical feature is the	123.   IFRS 9, in paragraphs 5.5.12 and B5.5.25-B5.5.27, sets out the requirements for the    assessment of significant increases in credit risk for lending exposures whose contractual cash    flows have been renegotiated or modified. In particular, for modifications that do not result in    derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity must assess whether credit risk has    increased significantly by comparing (a) the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date    based on the modified contractual terms with (b) the risk of default occurring upon initial    recognition based on the original, unmodified contractual terms.	
18-guideline.txt	102.   IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.2, states that lifetime expected credit losses are generally    expected to be recognised before a financial instrument becomes past due and that ‘typically,    credit risk increases significantly before a financial instrument becomes past due or other    lagging borrower-specific factors (for example a modification or restructuring) are observed’.    Therefore, credit institutions’ analyses should take into account the fact that the    determinants of credit losses very often begin to deteriorate a considerable time (months or,    in some cases, years) before any objective evidence of delinquency appears in the lending    exposures affected. Credit institutions should be mindful that delinquency data are generally    backward-looking, and will seldom on their own be appropriate in the implementation of an    ECL approach. For example, within retail portfolios adverse developments in macroeconomic    factors and borrower attributes will generally lead to an increase in the level of credit risk    long before this manifests itself in lagging information such as delinquency.	124.    Credit institutions should ensure that modifications or renegotiations do not obscure    increases in credit risk and thereby cause ECL to be underestimated and to delay the transfer    to lifetime ECL for obligors whose credit risk has significantly deteriorated, or inappropriately    result in a move from lifetime ECL measurement back to 12-month ECL measurement.	
18-guideline.txt	103.   Thus, in order to meet the objective of IFRS 9 in a robust manner, credit institutions    should also consider the linkages between macroeconomic factors and borrower attributes to    the level of credit risk in a portfolio based on reasonable and supportable information. To that    end, credit institutions should start with a detailed analysis of historical patterns and current    trends, which would allow for identification of the most relevant credit risk drivers.    Experienced credit judgement should facilitate the incorporation of current and forecasted    conditions likely to affect those risk drivers, the expected cash shortfalls and therefore loss    expectations.	126.    Lending exposures transferred to lifetime ECL that are subsequently renegotiated or    modified, and not derecognised, should not move back to 12-month ECL measurement unless    there is sufficient evidence that the credit risk over the life of the exposure has not increased    significantly compared with that upon initial recognition. For example, where a credit    institution grants various concessions such as interest rate reductions or postponements of    principal repayments to obligors in financial difficulty, the lending exposure may exhibit    characteristics of a lower credit risk even though in reality the obligor may continue to    experience financial difficulty with no realistic prospects of making scheduled repayments    over the remaining term of the exposure. In accordance with paragraph B5.5.27 of IFRS 9    ‘evidence that the criteria for the recognition of lifetime ECL are no longer met could include    a history of up-to-date and timely payment performance against the modified contractual    terms. Typically, a customer would need to demonstrate consistently good payment    behaviour over a period of time before the credit risk is considered to have decreased. For    example, a history of missed or incomplete payments would not typically be erased by simply    making one payment on time following a modification of the contractual terms’.	
18-guideline.txt	104.   Credit institutions should perform analyses of this kind not only in the context of    portfolios of individually small credits, such as credit card exposures, but also for large,    individually managed lending exposures. For example, for a large commercial property loan,    credit institutions should take account of the considerable sensitivity of the commercial    property market in many jurisdictions to the general macroeconomic environment, and    consider using information such as levels of interest rates or vacancy rates to determine    whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.	127.   IFRS 9 includes a number of practical expedients, intended to ease the implementation    burden for a wide range of companies in recognition of the fact that IFRS 9 will be used by a    variety of entities, including entities outside the banking industry.	
18-guideline.txt	105.    Credit institutions should have a clear policy including well-developed criteria on what    constitutes a ‘significant’ increase in credit risk for different types of lending exposures. Such    criteria and the reasons why these approaches and definitions are considered appropriate    should be disclosed in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures,    paragraph 35F. IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, requires that, when making the assessment of    significant increases in credit risk, ‘an entity shall use the change in the risk of default    occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument instead of the change in the    amount of expected credit losses’. For these purposes, institutions should make this    assessment in terms of the risk of a default occurring and not expected credit loss (i.e. before    consideration of the effects of credit risk mitigants such as collateral or guarantees).	128.  The paragraphs below address the following practical expedients: the information set    which an entity must consider in measuring ECL; the exception for ‘low’ credit risk exposures;    and the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption.	
18-guideline.txt	106.    In developing their approach to determining a significant increase in credit risk, credit    institutions should consider each of the 16 classes of indicators in IFRS 9 (insofar as they are    relevant to the financial instrument being assessed) as set out in paragraphs B5.5.17(a)-(p)    and, in addition, credit institutions should consider whether there is further information that    should be taken into account. Such indicators (in both IFRS 9 and these guidelines) should not    be viewed as a ‘checklist’. Some may be more relevant than others to assessing whether a    particular type of lending exposure exhibits a significant increase in credit risk. At the same    time, credit institutions should take particular care to avoid the risk of a significant increase in    credit risk not being acknowledged promptly when it is, in fact, present. In particular, credit    institutions should not restrict significant increases in credit risk to situations when a financial    instrument is anticipated to become credit impaired (i.e. the third stage of IFRS 9 impairment    requirements). Rather, debtors may exhibit a significant increase in credit risk without    evidence that the related lending exposures are likely to become impaired. The fact that    credit risk has increased significantly does not necessarily mean that default is probable —    merely that it is more likely than at initial recognition. This point is underlined by the    symmetry of the IFRS 9 model: it is possible for lending exposures to move to lifetime ECL but    subsequently be moved back to 12-month ECL if the threshold of a significant increase in    credit risk is no longer met.	129.    Credit institutions should make limited use of those practical expedients as they have the    potential to introduce significant bias and because — given their business — the cost of    obtaining the relevant information is not likely to involve ‘undue cost or effort’. Credit    institutions should consider the need to make adjustments when using practical expedients to    avoid any resulting bias, as they should take into account that the objective of IFRS 9 is to    estimate expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that    is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17).	
18-guideline.txt	109.    Accurate identification of drivers of credit risk, and reliable demonstration of the linkages    between those drivers and the level of credit risk, should be considered as critical, as a    seemingly small change in a qualitative characteristic of a loan can potentially be a leading    indicator of a large increase in the risk of a default occurring. Furthermore, in accordance with    IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the significance of a change in credit risk since initial recognition    depends on the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition. In this regard, where a credit    institution uses changes in PD as a means of identifying changes in the risk of a default    occurring, it should take into consideration the significance of a given change in PD expressed    in a ratio (or the rate of fluctuation) proportionate to the PD at initial recognition (i.e. a    change in the PD divided by the PD at initial recognition), considering also paragraph B5.5.11	130.   Where a credit institution uses such practical expedients, justifications for the use of    practical expedients should be clearly documented by the credit institution.	
18-guideline.txt	110.    Credit institutions should look beyond how many ‘grades’ a rating downgrade entails    because the change in PD for a one-grade movement may not be linear (for example, the    default probability over five years of an exposure rated BB is around three times that of one    rated BBB, based on current data and analyses applicable to certain jurisdictions).    Furthermore, because the significance of a one-grade movement would depend on the    granularity of a bank’s rating system — and hence the ‘width’ of each grade — an appropriate    initial segmentation should be defined to ensure that a significant increase in credit risk for an    individual lending exposure or a group of lending exposures is not obscured within a segment.    In this regard, credit institutions should ensure that credit risk rating systems include a    sufficient number of grades to appropriately distinguish credit risk. Credit institutions should    also be mindful of the fact that a significant increase in credit risk could occur prior to a    movement in a credit grade.	131.    IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.15, states that ´an entity shall consider reasonable and    supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort´ and that ‘an entity    need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit    risk has increased significantly since initial recognition’. Credit institutions should not read    these statements restrictively and should develop systems and processes that use all    reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the group of exposures or    individual exposure, as needed to achieve a high-quality, robust and consistent    implementation of the accounting requirements. Nevertheless, additional cost and    operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a highquality implementation of IFRS 9.	
18-guideline.txt	111.   Credit institutions should take into account that there are some circumstances in which    an adverse movement in the factors listed in paragraphs 107 and 108 above might not be    indicative of a significant increase in credit risk. For example, it may be the case that the    default probability of a lending exposure rated AA is low, and not much greater than one    rated AAA. However, very few lending exposures are of such apparently low credit risk — and,    as noted in paragraph 110, the sensitivity of default probability to rating grades may increase    strongly as rating quality declines.	132.    In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, ´an entity may assume that the credit risk    on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial    instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date´. Although credit    institutions thus have the option for ‘low credit risk’ exposures not to assess whether credit    risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be    limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant    increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.	
18-guideline.txt	112.   Credit institutions should also be aware that there could be circumstances in which some    factors move in an adverse direction but may be counterbalanced by improvement in others    (see IFRS 9 Implementation Guidance, Example 2). Nonetheless, in view of the importance of    detecting whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions    should put in place governance and control processes capable of reliably validating any    judgement that factors which may have an adverse impact on credit risk are counterbalanced    by factors which may have a favourable impact.	133.   In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL    through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending    exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order    to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption    should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is    sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have    occurred.	
18-guideline.txt	113.    Credit institutions should give thorough consideration and full weight to discretionary    decisions by a credit institution’s management body or senior management which point to a    change in credit risk. For example, if because of concerns about credit risk a decision is made    to intensify the monitoring of a borrower or class of borrowers, it is unlikely that such action    would have been taken by the decision-maker had the increase in credit risk not been    perceived as significant.	134.    To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9,    paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external ‘investment grade’    rating. However, all lending exposures that have an ‘investment grade’ rating from a credit    rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should    rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a    lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating    agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as    compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit    institution’s management body or senior management.	
18-guideline.txt	114.    When a credit institution assesses that there has been a significant increase in credit risk    for some, but not all, of its lending exposures to a counterparty — for example, because of    differences in the timing of when lending was provided — it should ensure that all lending    exposures are identified where there has been a significant increase in credit risk.	137.   In this regard, credit institutions should use relevant forward-looking information that is    reasonable and supportable to analyse whether there is any substantive relationship between    such information and credit risk drivers. Credit institutions should not use the 30-days-pastdue rebuttable presumption unless they have demonstrated that the forward-looking    information had no substantive relationship with the credit risk driver or such information is    not available without undue cost or effort.	
18-guideline.txt	                                                                                                  43 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	138.   In the limited instances where past-due information is the best criterion available to a    credit institution to determine when exposures should move to the lifetime ECL category,    credit institutions should pay particular attention to their measurement of 12-month ECL    allowance to ensure that ECL are appropriately captured in accordance with the    measurement objective of IFRS 9. Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that    significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the    implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives    of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement    objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met.	
18-guideline.txt	115.   Where a credit institution makes the assessment of significant increases in credit risk on a    collective basis (i.e. such as retail), the definitions of portfolios should be reviewed regularly    to ensure that the lending exposures within them continue to share risk characteristics in    terms of their response to credit risk drivers. Changing economic conditions may require    regrouping.	140.    In making these evaluations, competent authorities may require credit institutions to    provide supplemental information, not publicly disclosed, through regular supervisory    reporting, ad hoc reporting or on-site examinations. Competent authorities could also use    these approaches for obtaining supplemental information when performing the evaluations    called for in the principles below.	
18-guideline.txt	116.    In line with paragraph B5.5.1 of IFRS 9 on the assessment of significant increases in credit    risk since initial recognition on a collective basis, in instances where it is apparent that, within    a group of lending exposures, some lending exposures have experienced a significant increase    in credit risk, credit institutions should transfer a subset or a proportion of the group of    lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement even though it is not possible to identify this    on an individual lending exposure basis (see IFRS 9, Illustrative Example 5).	     Competent authorities should also consider a credit institution’s credit risk practices when      assessing a credit institution’s overall capital adequacy.	
18-guideline.txt	117.   Consistent with paragraph B5.5.6 of IFRS 9 and paragraph IE39 of the Implementation    Guidance for IFRS 9, if it is not possible on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics to    identify a particular subgroup of lending exposures for which credit risk has increased    significantly, an appropriate proportion of the overall group should be subject to lifetime ECL    measurement.	5.1 Cost-benefit analysis/impact assessment Article 16(2) of the EBA Regulation provides that, where appropriate, the EBA should analyse ‘the related potential costs and benefits’ of guidelines issued by the EBA. Such analysis shall be proportionate in relation to the scope, nature and impact of the guidelines. The following section provides an impact assessment (‘IA’) of the guidelines. It includes an overview of the findings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions and the potential impact of these options.	
18-guideline.txt	118.   ‘Significant’ should not be equated with statistical significance, meaning that the    assessment approach should not be based solely on quantitative analysis. For portfolios which    have a large number of individually small credits, and a rich set of relevant historical data, it    may be possible to identify ‘significant’ increases in credit risk in part by using statistical    techniques. However, for other lending exposures, that may not be feasible.	Some respondents believe that the guidelines should develop further the requirements for the application of the principle of proportionality and provide more guidance on this aspect, but they believe also that the guidelines are too prescriptive regarding the use of practical expedients (to allow these to be applied only in the case of smaller and less complex credit institutions). The majority of the respondents who answered the question on the impact assessment expressed a preference for the application of the guidelines in a proportionate manner without defining more specific criteria (option 2.1).	
18-guideline.txt	119.    ‘Significant’ should also not be judged in terms of the extent of impact on a credit    institution’s primary financial statements. Identification and disclosure of significant increases    in credit risk should be undertaken, even where an increase in credit risk defined in terms of    probability of default is unlikely to affect the allowance made — for example, because the    exposure is more than fully collateralised — to allow credit institutions to identify and    disclose such increases which are likely to be important to users seeking to understand trends    in the intrinsic credit risk of a credit institution’s lending exposures.	In many cases several industry bodies made similar comments or the same body repeated its comments in the response to different questions. In such cases, the comments, and EBA analysis, are included in the section of this analysis where the EBA considers them most pertinent.	
18-guideline.txt	120.   In accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the assessment of significant increases in    credit risk is based on comparing credit risk on exposures at the reporting date relative to    credit risk upon initial recognition. IFRS 9, paragraph BC 5.161, and Illustrative Example 6    represent an example of the application of this principle in the Standard, rather than an    exception to that principle. This example suggests that credit institutions can set a maximum    credit risk for particular portfolios upon initial recognition that would lead to that portfolio    moving to lifetime ECL measurement when credit risk increases beyond that maximum level.    This simplification is only relevant when exposures are segmented on a sufficiently granular    basis such that a credit institution can demonstrate that the analysis is consistent with the    principles of IFRS 9. Specifically, credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that a	Changes to the draft guidelines have been incorporated when relevant as a result of the responses received during the public consultation.	
19-guideline.txt	7.   These Guidelines were drafted taking into account complaints procedures that CAs have already      put in place to deal with complaints under Article 80 of Directive 2007/64/EC (PSD1). In      particular, Article 80(1) of PSD1 provides that ‘Member States shall ensure that procedures are      set up which allow payment service users and other interested parties including consumer      associations, to submit complaints to the CAs with regard to PSPs’ alleged infringements of the      provisions of national law implementing the provisions of this Directive’. Article 82 of PSD1      further states that Member States shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that the      complaints procedures provided for in Article 80(1) and 81(1) are administered by the      authorities empowered to ensure compliance with the provisions of national law adopted      pursuant to the requirements laid down in that Article.	16. Several respondents suggested that additional information should be requested from     complainants. Other respondents, on the contrary, considered that part of the information     requested in Guideline 2 cannot be provided by complainants and that the requirements should     avoid being overly burdensome, which might discourage complainants from filing a complaint.	
19-guideline.txt	8.   In summary, these Guidelines are aimed at fulfilling the EBA’s overall objective, as set out in      Article 1(5) of the EBA Regulation, of ensuring the consistent, efficient and effective application      of the legislative acts that fall into the EBA’s scope of action.	17. Given that Article 100(6) of PSD2 provides that CAs shall take the complaints procedures into     consideration for monitoring and ensuring compliance with PSD2, the EBA considers that the     information specified in Guideline 2 contains all relevant details to put CAs in a position to fulfil     this task effectively. However, the EBA would like to highlight that provision of the information     requested in Guideline 2 is not mandatory for complainants.	
19-guideline.txt	9.   A draft Consultation Paper on the Guidelines was published in February 2017 for a three-month      consultation period, which closed on 16 May 2017. The EBA received 12 responses from various      market participants, such as PSPs, trade associations and consumer associations. These      respondents raised 59 distinct issues.	18. In addition, the EBA would like to highlight that CAs can request additional information from     complainants if the information provided is deemed insufficient for the assessment of the     complaint.	
19-guideline.txt	10. The EBA assessed the responses from the consultation and made changes to the Guidelines     where relevant. The Feedback table in Chapter 4.2 (pages 22 to 42) provides an exhaustive and     comprehensive list of all the responses and their respective analysis by the EBA. The Rationale     section below summarises the subset of the key issues raised by respondents, and changes     made to the Guidelines.	19. However, to address the issues raised, and to bring greater clarity, the EBA deleted the first part     of Guideline 2.1., which indicated that the information specified in the Guideline is requested     when the complaint is being submitted. The EBA then separated the existing Guideline 2.1. into     two new Guidelines: the new Guideline 2.1. concerning the request for information by CAs, and     Guideline 2.2. concerning the recording of that information.	
19-guideline.txt	3.2. Rationale	Payment service providers in the scope of ‘other interested parties’	
19-guideline.txt	11. The key issues and requests for clarification identified by the EBA relate to the channels for     submission of complaints, the information requested from complainants, the PSPs in the scope     of ‘other interested parties’, submission of complaints to the responsible CAs and the aggregate     analysis of complaints.	20. Many of the respondents to the consultation considered that the EBA should clarify that PSPs     should also be considered ‘other interested parties’ for the purpose of the Guidelines and that     PSPs should be able to make use of the complaints procedures introduced in PSD2 and further     specified through the Guidelines. FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2366	
19-guideline.txt	Channels for submission of complaints	21. Article 99(1) of PSD2 refers to ‘other interested parties including consumer associations’,     without making any additional specification, which means the reference to consumer     associations is not exhaustive.	
19-guideline.txt	12. In terms of channels for submission of complaints, many of the respondents expressed the     opinion that the EBA should harmonise the channels, while others suggested that one of the     available channels for submission of complaints should be digital and accessible online, such as     an email or a web form.	22. The EBA therefore concludes that, for the purpose of these Guidelines, a PSP that is affected by     the situation that gave rise to that complaint is to be considered an ‘other interested party’ that     can raise a complaint of an alleged infringement of PSD2. This includes cases where it is not only     the PSP, but also a payment service user, that is affected by the alleged infringement, for     example when the payment service user is being prevented from making use of a payment     service provided by the PSP that has raised the complaint.	
19-guideline.txt	23. Nevertheless, the EBA would like to emphasise that CAs will retain discretion to decide whether     or not they will also apply the complaints procedures specified under these Guidelines to a PSP     that is not affected by the situation that gave rise to the complaint.	30. The EBA agrees that this suggestion would bring more transparency to the complaints     procedures, by informing complainants about the authority or body to which their complaint has     been forwarded and from which they might expect further communication. The EBA also     considers that complainants might benefit from having the contact details of that CA or body, in     case they would like to provide additional information for their complaint.	
19-guideline.txt	24. Some of the respondents to the consultation considered that, in a case of an alleged     infringement of PSD2 related to cross-border provision of payment services, the Guidelines     should specify that complainants should address their complaints to the CA in the home     Member State where the PSP was authorised or registered.	31. As a result, the EBA clarified in Guideline 3.1.c. that the information on whether or not the CA     has forwarded the complaint to another authority or body should also include the name and     contact details of that authority or body. The EBA also changed the wording of Guideline 6.1.b.,     which now requires CAs to also make publicly available information on how each channel for     submission of information will be accessed.	
19-guideline.txt	25. The Guidelines stay silent about to which CA complainants should submit their complaints,     because different complaints would require complainants to approach different CAs, which     might not be known in advance. It should also be taken into account that complainants might     not always be aware that they should address their complaints to the CA in the home Member     State, and that they might even not be able to identify that CA. Furthermore, the procedure for     filing a complaint to a CA in another Member State could be burdensome for some     complainants.	33. By way of response, the EBA would like to highlight that the purpose of these Guidelines is to     establish a procedure for submission of complaints related to alleged infringements of PSD2.     The information under Guideline 4.1.f. is related to the overall assessment of complaints and the     subsequent supervisory measures taken by the CA. Taking into account the sensitivity of this     information, the EBA is of the view that the question of whether or not the aggregate analysis of     complaints under Guideline 4 should be made publicly available is a matter to be left to national     administrative laws and CAs’ internal policies and procedures.	
19-guideline.txt	26. Furthermore, Guideline 3.1.c. specifies that the complainant should be provided with     ‘information on whether the competent authority has forwarded the complaint to another     authority or body which may be located in the same or in another country’.	34. Another comment related to the aggregate analysis of complaints suggests that payment     instruments and payment channels should be taken into consideration.	
19-guideline.txt	27. PSD2 also stays silent about to which CA complainants should submit their complaints. PSD2     establishes requirements on cooperation between CAs, including in a cross-border context. In     addition, Article 29(6) of PSD2 confers a mandate on the EBA to develop regulatory technical     standards specifying the framework for cooperation, and for the exchange of information,     between the CAs of the home and the host Member States. The EBA considers that these     measures are sufficient in allowing the complaint to reach the responsible CA.	35. The EBA agrees with the rationale behind this proposal, but, taking into account that the term     ‘payment channel’ is not defined in PSD2 and that payment instruments are linked to the     provision of a specific payment service, the EBA has introduced payment services as another     criterion to be assessed in the aggregate analysis of complaints.	
19-guideline.txt	28. Finally, there might be some cases related to the provision of cross-border services via the right     of establishment, where the responsible CA might be the CA of the host Member State. In     addition, the CA in the host Member State could benefit from the information contained in the FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2366	36. The EBA also considers that information about the payment instrument or payment channel     used by the complainant will be included in the issues most complained about under     Guideline 4.1.d., which is linked to the description of the situation that gave rise to the     complaint under Guideline 2.1.e. FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/2366	
19-guideline.txt	29. One respondent suggested that, when CAs respond to complainants and inform complainants     that the CA has forwarded the complaint to another authority or body, the CA should also     provide the contact details of the authority or body to which it has forwarded the complaint.	2. Guidelines set out the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European    System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area.    Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to which    Guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g.    by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where    Guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.	
19-guideline.txt	30. The EBA agrees that this suggestion would bring more transparency to the complaints     procedures, by informing complainants about the authority or body to which their complaint has     been forwarded and from which they might expect further communication. The EBA also     considers that complainants might benefit from having the contact details of that CA or body, in     case they would like to provide additional information for their complaint.	3. According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must    notify the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with these Guidelines, or    otherwise with reasons for non-compliance, by ([dd.mm.yyyy]). In the absence of any    notification by this deadline, competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be noncompliant . Notifications should be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website    to compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference ‘EBA/GL/201x/xx’. Notifications should be    submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their    competent authorities. Any change in the status of compliance must also be reported to EBA.	
19-guideline.txt	31. As a result, the EBA clarified in Guideline 3.1.c. that the information on whether or not the CA     has forwarded the complaint to another authority or body should also include the name and     contact details of that authority or body. The EBA also changed the wording of Guideline 6.1.b.,     which now requires CAs to also make publicly available information on how each channel for     submission of information will be accessed.	5. These Guidelines address the requirement for the EBA to issue Guidelines under    Article 100(6) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the    internal market.	
19-guideline.txt	6. These Guidelines apply to complaints submitted to competent authorities with regard to    payment service providers’ alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 as laid down in    Article 99(1) of the Directive. These complaints are to be taken into consideration by    competent authorities to ensure and monitor effective compliance with Directive    (EU) 2015/2366, as referred to in Article 100(6) of the Directive. These complaints may be    submitted by payment service users and other interested parties, including payment service    providers that are affected by the situation(s) that gave rise to the complaint and consumer    associations (‘complainants’).	Analysing the current procedures for complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 established in EU Member States under PSD1 allows the EBA to benefit from best practices in the field. Various scenarios about the scope of these Guidelines and about the requirements for competent authorities have been considered.	
19-guideline.txt	7. These Guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point i) of Article 4(2)    of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and designated by Member States to ensure and monitor    effective compliance with Directive (EU) 2015/2366, in accordance with Article 100(1) of that    Directive.	Insufficient information submitted to competent authorities by complainants hinders the efficient handling of the complaint. These Guidelines address this issue by requiring competent authorities to offer sufficient channels for complainants to submit their complaints (Guideline 1) and by setting a list of elements that competent authorities should request from complainants when the

19-guideline.txt	4. Guidelines on procedures for complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366	The Guidelines require measures to remove current barriers to submit complaints. To this end, Guideline 3 requires competent authorities when responding to complainants to acknowledge the receipt of each complaint, and to provide a number of information elements to complainants without undue delay. The EBA considered several options on the scope and detail of the reply to the complainants. The retained option ensures that competent authorities can choose to further communicate with complainants provided that they include in each communication information on when and how the competent authority will further communicate with the complainant on the alleged infringement of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, or information on whether or not the reply is intended to finalise the complaints procedure with the competent authority (Guideline 3.3.).	
19-guideline.txt	Guideline 1: Channels for the submission of complaints of alleged infringements of Directive (EU) 2015/2366	The Guidelines will affect competent authorities, payment service users and other interested parties, including payment service providers that are affected by the situation that gave rise to the complaint and consumer associations. The options adopted in the Guidelines describe the complaints procedures in a high-level way that allows competent authorities to take into account national specificities and what they consider will work best in their jurisdictions when implementing the Guidelines at national level. The Guidelines are based on current best practices and therefore allow competent authorities to leverage on the procedures they already have in place.	
2-guideline.txt	1. This document contains guidelines issued pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No    1093/2010 1. In accordance with Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent    authorities and financial institutions must make every effort to comply with the guidelines.	64. Risk measures should be based on reliable market and internal data. Institutions should     scrutinize the quality of external sources of information used to establish the historical databases     of interest rates, as well as the frequency at which databases are updated. To ensure the high     quality of data, institutions should implement appropriate processes that ensure that the data     entered into IT system is correct. Institutions should also establish appropriate mechanisms to     verify the correctness of the aggregation process and the reliability of model results. These     mechanisms should confirm the accuracy and reliability of data.	
2-guideline.txt	2. Guidelines outline the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System    of Financial Supervision or of how European Union law should be applied in a particular area.    Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom    guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g. by    amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are    directed primarily at institutions.	65. The institution should have appropriate procedures to handle any discrepancies and     irregularities that arise at the time of data processing. The institution should determine the     reasons for these and should have procedures in place for the mutual reconciliation of the     positions to enable these discrepancies and irregularities to be eliminated.	
2-guideline.txt	3. According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must notify    the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with these guidelines, or otherwise with    reasons for non-compliance, by 07.12.2015. In the absence of any notification by this deadline,    competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non-compliant. Notifications should    be sent by submitting the form available on the EBA website to compliance@eba.europa.eu with    the reference ‘EBA/GL/2015/08’. Notifications should be submitted by persons with appropriate    authority to report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities. Any change in the    status of compliance must also be reported to EBA.	66. The institution should set up an appropriate process to ensure that the data used to feed models     measuring the IRRBB across the group, e.g. for simulating earnings, is consistent with the data     used for corporate planning.	
2-guideline.txt	4. Notifications will be published on the EBA website, in line with Article 16(3).	d) Internal Reporting	
2-guideline.txt	6. The level of application of these guidelines should be consistent with the level of application of    supervisory review and evaluation process. These guidelines cover measurement methods for    both economic value and earnings effects of IRRBB.	67. The frequency of internal reports should increase with the complexity of the institution’s     operations, with quarterly reports being the minimum frequency for institutions with less     complex portfolios. Similarly, the content of the reports should reflect changes in the risk profile     of the institution and in the economic environment.	
2-guideline.txt	7. These guidelines do not apply to risks arising from changes in the perceived credit quality of    individual instruments, which may result in fluctuations in spreads relative to underlying interest    rates (credit spread risk).	68. Internal reports should be provided to the different levels of management, and should contain     an appropriate level of information for the particular level (e.g. management body, senior     management) and for the specific situation of the institution and the economic environment.	
2-guideline.txt	8. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2) of    Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and to financial institutions as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation    (EU) No 1093/2010.	69. Aggregated information should provide sufficient detail to enable the management to assess the     sensitivity of the institution to changes in market conditions and other important risk factors.     These reports should contain information on exposures to repricing, basis, yield curve and     optionality risk as well as information on the types and results of stress tests performed,     including the standard shocks prescribed by the competent authority.	
2-guideline.txt	9. Unless otherwise specified, terms used and defined in Directive 2013/36/EU and in Regulation    (EU) No 575/2013 have the same meaning in the guidelines.	2.     Competent authorities should ensure that procedures exist for the identification of such        securitisation transactions which should, notwithstanding compliance with points (a) or (b)        of Articles 243(2) or 244(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, be subject to further review by        the competent authority in accordance with Title III of these Guidelines in order to assess        whether a commensurate transfer of credit risk to third parties has indeed been achieved        by the transaction.	
2-guideline.txt	11. These guidelines apply from 1 January 2016.	3.     The conditions for achieving SRT to third parties should be satisfied on a continuous basis.	
2-guideline.txt	12. The CEBS guidelines on technical aspects of the management of interest rate risk arising from     non-trading activities under the supervisory review process, dated 3 October 2006, are repealed     with effect from 1 January 2016.	4.     Originator institutions should assess the reliance placed on external credit assessments in        their analyses of transactions claiming SRT and the relationship between such external        credit assessments and internal credit assessments.	
2-guideline.txt	13. Institutions should comply with these guidelines in a manner proportionate to their size,     complexity and intensity of activity, taking account of Table 3 in Annex B and the provisions of     Title 2.1.1 of the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory     review and evaluation process (SREP guidelines). 2	Title II- Criteria for competent authorities in case of application of Article 243(2) or Article 244(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013	
2-guideline.txt	17. When measuring their IRRBB institutions should not rely on the calculations of the outcome of     the supervisory standard shock as set out in Article 98(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU or in IRRBB 5,     but should develop and use their own assumptions and calculation methods.	3.     Criteria to determine when competent authorities should conduct a comprehensive        review of SRT in case of application of Article 243(2) or Article 244(2) of Regulation        (EU) 575/2013	
2-guideline.txt	IRRBB 3 – Interest Rate Shock Scenarios	1.   With regard to those securitisation transactions meeting the conditions for achieving SRT in      accordance with points (a) or (b) of Article 243(2) or Article 244(2) of Regulation (EU) No      575/2013, competent authorities should conduct a comprehensive review of SRT in      accordance with Title III, paragraphs 4 to 10 of these Guidelines, where any of the following      circumstances contained in the non-exhaustive list below applies:	
2-guideline.txt	18. Institutions should routinely measure EV and NII/earnings sensitivity under different scenarios     for potential changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve, and to changes in     the relationship between different market rates (i.e. basis risk).	1.    Originator institutions should provide the competent authority with all requested       information of the securitisations on which they intend to demonstrate SRT, so that       competent authorities can conduct the assessment of SRT to third parties as specified in Title       I to Title III of these Guidelines.	
20-guideline.txt	1.   Competent authorities should assess if there are structural features in a transaction which      might undermine the claimed credit risk transfer to third parties, such as features like      optional calls or other contractual arrangements which in case of traditional securitisations      increase the likelihood that assets will be brought back onto the originator institution’s      balance sheet or in case of synthetic securitisations increase the likelihood that the credit      protection will be terminated before the transaction’s maturity.	2.    Originator institutions should at least notify the relevant competent authority of any       securitisation on which they intend to demonstrate SRT which is not similar in structure and       portfolio composition to previous transactions notified by the institution.	
20-guideline.txt	2.   For traditional securitisations, only the following call options granted to originator      institutions should not be considered detrimental to achieving effective transfer of credit risk      by competent authorities, provided these call options do not grant an originator institution      the right to repurchase from the transferee the previously transferred exposure to realise      their benefits or oblige the originator institution to re-assume transferred credit risk:	12.    Governance and policies around SRT assessments	
20-guideline.txt	6.   Where transactions include replenishment periods, competent authorities should consider      the eligibility criteria of the assets in the underlying pool and give consideration to the      minimum and maximum credit quality of eligible assets, and consider if the assets can be      substituted into the structure with the view to protecting investors from losses while      increasing credit risk to the originator institution to ensure that risk has effectively been      transferred.	1.    Originator institutions should have a governance process in place for evaluating transactions       claiming SRT. This process should include details of relevant committees, any internal       approval procedure, and evidence of appropriate stakeholder involvement and a suitable,       auditable trail of documentation.	
20-guideline.txt	7.   Competent authorities should consider that transactions do not include any embedded      mechanism at origination that is reducing the amount of credit risk transfer by the originator      institution to third parties disproportionately over time.	2.    Originator institutions should have appropriate systems and controls regarding SRT through       securitisation, including for the ongoing monitoring of SRT requirements, at least on a       quarterly basis, throughout the maturity of relevant transactions.	
20-guideline.txt	6.     Mismatches between credit protection and underlying assets for synthetic        securitisations	3.    Originator institutions should have policies and methodologies in place that ensure ongoing       compliance with all SRT requirements according to Articles 243 and 244 of Regulation (EU)       No 575/2013.	
20-guideline.txt	1.   Competent authorities should consider if there are maturity or currency mismatches      between the protection provided and the underlying assets. When considering the maturity      of the protection, competent authorities should consider whether optional calls or other      features might reduce the maturity of the protection in practice, and how this relates to the      expected time of defaults on the asset pool.	                                                                                                 17 GUIDELINES ON SIGNIFICANT RISK TRANSFER FOR SECURITISATION	
20-guideline.txt	2.   Competent authorities should assess maturity mismatches for transactions where asset pools      are able to replenish as originator institutions may substitute in longer maturity assets      towards the back-end of the protection period, increasing any maturity mismatch.	Part. 2 - Specific requirements for originator institutions in order to comply with Article 243(4) or 244(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013	
20-guideline.txt	3.   Competent authorities should assess currency mismatches for transactions where asset      pools contain a different currency profile to the liabilities. Where such mismatches occur,      prudent haircuts should be applied to the capital relief sought in accordance with the views      of the competent authorities. Mitigating instruments, such as currency swaps should be      assessed for appropriateness in terms of the balance swapped, the duration of the swap      itself, and any contingent triggers.	13.    Risk-management and self-assessment	
20-guideline.txt	1.   Where the securitisation is achieved synthetically using a credit derivative or a guarantee,      competent authorities should ensure that the credit protection meets all the relevant      requirements set forth in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and provides sufficient certainty of      payment so as not to undermine the credit risk transfer. If the credit protection is funded,      the collateral arrangements should be considered including that they meet all the relevant      requirements set forth by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for funded credit protection. If the      credit protection is unfunded, competent authorities should consider whether suitable      arrangements are in place to ensure timely payment.	1.    Originator institutions should have policies and methodologies in place that ensure the       possible reduction of own funds requirements achieved by originator institutions through       securitisation is justified by a commensurate credit risk transfer to third parties.	
20-guideline.txt	2.   Competent authorities should consider the credit events that are covered by the credit      protection obtained (e.g. whether it includes standard credit events like bankruptcy, failure      to pay or restructuring of loans).	2.    Originator institutions’ SRT policies should be part of their broader capital allocation       strategies. In particular, the originator institutions’ policies on transfer of credit risk and SRT       to third parties should specify how transactions claiming SRT align with originator       institutions’ overall risk management strategies and internal capital allocation.

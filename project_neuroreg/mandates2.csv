      23.In the development and implementation of their NPE strategies, credit institutions should  	  take  into  account  relevant  consumer  protection  considerations  and  requirements,  and      ensure  fair  treatment  of  consumers.            	1
24.Credit institutions should establish an NPE strategy to target a time-bound reduction of NPEs    over a realistic	but  sufficiently  ambitious  time  horizon  (NPE  reduction  targets).  The  NPE      strategy  should  lay  out  the  credit  institution’s  approach  and  objectives  regarding  effective      management  to  maximise  recoveries  and  ultimately  a  reduction  in  NPE  stocks  in  a  clear,      credible  and  feasible  manner  for  each  relevant  portfolio.  When  developing  and      implementing  the  NPE  strategy  for  retail  portfolios,  credit  institutions  should  consider      provisions  aimed  at  protecting  consumers,  including  Directive  2014/17/EU,  13      Directive  2008/48/EC14  and  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  arrears  and  foreclosure.15          	1

   25.The following steps should form the core building blocks of the development and       implementation of the NPE	strategy:    	1
   26.When credit institutions develop their NPE strategy, they should also consider policies that       aim to ensure the	fair  treatment  of  borrowers.            	1
27.As a first phase in the formulation and execution of an appropriate NPE strategy, credit       institutions should complete an assessment	of  the  following  elements:            	1
   28.Credit institutions should perform a comprehensive self-assessment to evaluate the actual       situation and the steps to be	taken  internally  to  address  any  gaps  in  the  internal  capabilities              to  manage  NPEs.          	1
   29.Institutions should fully     	understand and assess: 	1
    c) Their operational capacities (processes, tools, data quality, IT/automation, staff/expertise,  decision-making, internal policies and any	other  relevant  area  for  the  implementation  of  the  strategy)  in  relation  to  the  various  steps  involved  in  the  process,  including  but  not  limited  to:              	1
   30.Credit institutions should perform a comprehensive self-assessment covering at least the       items listed in paragraph 29 on	an  annual  basis  to  determine  strengths,  significant  gaps  and              areas  of  improvement  required  to  reach  NPE  reduction  targets.              	1
   31.Credit institutions should report the outcome of the comprehensive self-assessment to the       institution’s management body and the	competent  authority.  	1
   32.Credit institutions should consider seeking expert views on their operational capabilities to       manage NPEs from the institution’s	risk  management  and  control  functions  or  from  external              sources  on  a  periodic  basis.          	1
   33.Credit institutions should assess and consider the current and likely future external operating       conditions and environment when	establishing  the  NPE  strategy  and  associated  NPE              reduction  targets.  The  following  list  of  external  factors,  where  appropriate,  should  be  taken              into  account  by  credit  institutions  when  setting  the  NPE  strategy:      	1
      34.Credit institutions should be able to calculate a detailed assessment of the impact of the     	        planned  strategy  from  capital,  risk  exposure  amount,  profit  or  loss,  and  impairment      perspectives  for  each  of  the  reduction  drivers,  and  they  should  assess  whether  the  bank  has      identified  a  strategic  process  to  resolve  any  shortfalls  under  different  economic  scenarios.      The  assessment  criteria,  underlying  assumptions  and  implications  should  be  aligned  with  the      RAF  as  well  as  with  the  internal  capital  adequacy  assessment  process  (ICAAP).16          	1
      35.Credit institutions should include suitable actions in their capital planning to ensure that the      	      level  of  available  capital  will  enable  a  sustainable  reduction  of  NPEs  on  the  balance  sheet.            	1
36.The NPE strategy should encompass, at a minimum, time-bound quantitative NPE targets and    foreclosed assets targets, supported,	where  appropriate,  by  a  corresponding  comprehensive      operational  plan.  The  development  of  the  NPE  strategy  should  be  informed  by  a  selfassessment  process  and  an  analysis  of  the  strategic  options  for  the  implementation  of  the      NPE  strategy.  The  NPE  strategy  and  operational  plan  should  be  defined  and  approved  by  the      management  body  and  reviewed  at  least  annually.          	1
      37.Credit institutions should consider including a combination of strategies and options in the       	    NPE  strategy  to  achieve  their  objectives  over  the  short,  medium  and  long  term.  In  order  to            	1
      38.Credit institutions should identify medium- and long-term strategy options for NPE   	reductions  that  may  not  be  achievable  immediately,  for  example  due  to  a  lack  of  immediate      NPE  investor  demand,  which  might  change  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  The  operational  plan      may  therefore  need  to  allow  for  such  changes  and  require  preparations  for  them,  for      example  by  enhancing  the  quality  of  NPE  data  in  order  to  be  ready  for  future  investor      transactions.        	1
      39.When a credit institution concludes that none of the above options will lead to a sufficient    	          NPE  reduction  in  the  medium  to  long  term  for  certain  portfolios  or  individual  exposures,  this      should  be  clearly  reflected  in  a  timely  impairment  and  write-off  approach.          	1
      40.Credit institutions aiming to engage in complex processes, such as NPE risk transfer and      	      securitisation  transactions,  should  conduct  robust  risk  analysis  and  have  adequate  risk      control  processes  in  place.17        	1
      41.Before commencing the short- to medium-term target-setting process, credit institutions    should	establish  a  view  of  reasonable  long-term  NPE  levels,  both  at  portfolio  level  and  at      aggregate  level.  Credit  institutions  should  take  into  account  historic  or  international      benchmarks  in  order  to  define  reasonable  long-term  NPE  levels.              	1
      42.Credit institutions should include, at a minimum, clearly defined realistic yet ambitious  	  quantitative  targets  in  their  NPE  strategy,  including  for  foreclosed  assets,  where  relevant.      These  targets  should  lead  to  a  concrete  reduction,  gross  and  net  of  impairments,  in  NPEs,  at              	1
   43.Credit institutions should  	establish targets as followings:   	1
   44.The NPE targets for credit institutions should at a minimum include a projected absolute or       relative NPE	reduction,  both  gross  and  net  of  impairments,  not  only  on  an  overall  basis  but              also  for  the  main  NPE  portfolios.  Where  foreclosed  assets  are  material,  a  foreclosed  assets              strategy  should  be  defined  or,  at  least,  foreclosed  assets  reduction  targets  should  be  included              in  the  NPE  strategy.    	1
   45.The NPE targets should be aligned with the more granular operational targets. Further       monitoring indicators can be	implemented  as  additional  targets,  if  deemed  appropriate.      	1
   46.The NPE strategy of the credit institution should be supported by an operational plan, which       should be	defined,  approved  and  reviewed  by  the  management  body.  The  operational  plan              should  clearly  define  how  the  credit  institution  will  operationally  implement  its  NPE  strategy              over  a  time  horizon  of  at  least  one  to  three  years  (depending  on  the  type  of  operational              measures  required).          	1
   48.The operational plan should have a specific focus on internal factors that could present       impediments to the	successful  delivery  of  the  NPE  strategy.        	1
49.The implementation of the NPE strategy operational plan should rely on suitable policies and       procedures, clear ownership and appropriate governance	structures,  including  escalation              procedures,  and  the  operational  plan  should  incorporate  wide-ranging  change  management              measures  in  order  to  embed  the  NPE  workout  framework  as  a  key  element  in  the  corporate              culture.        	1
   50.Credit institutions should report material deviations from the plan to the management body       and to the competent	authority  in  a  timely  manner,  with  appropriate  remediation  actions  to              be  put  in  place.        	1
51.As the execution and delivery of the NPE strategy will involve and depend on many different       areas within the credit	institution,  it  should  be  embedded  in  processes  at  all  levels  of  the              organisation,  including  strategic  and  operational,  including  the  risk  committee  as  defined  in              Article  76(3)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.        	1
   52.Credit institutions should emphasise to all relevant staff the key components of the NPE       strategy in line	with  the  approach  taken  to  the  institution’s  overall  strategy  and  in  particular              the  risk  strategy  as  defined  in  Article  76  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.  This  is  especially  important              if  the  implementation  of  the  NPE  strategy  will  involve  wide-ranging  changes  to  business              procedures.              	1
   53.Credit institutions should clearly define and document the roles, responsibilities and formal       reporting lines for the implementation	of  the  NPE  strategy  and  operational  plan.      	1
   54.Staff and management involved in NPE workout activities should be provided with clear       individual (or team) goals	and  incentives  geared  towards  reaching  the  targets  agreed  in  the              NPE  strategy  and  operational  plan.  Related  remuneration  policies,  career  development              objectives  and  performance  monitoring  frameworks  should  take  the  NPE  targets  into              account  in  order  to  ensure  the  full  engagement  of  staff  and  management  with  NPE  reduction              and  should  also  have  regard  to  the  fair  treatment  of  consumers.  The  incentive  scheme  for              staff  and  managers  in  the  loan  origination/business  units  should  also  take  into  account  the              feedback  from  the  workout  activities  and  the  quality  of  the  credit  institution’s  exposures  in        	1
      55.All relevant components of the NPE strategy should be fully aligned with and integrated into     	        the  business  plan  and  budget,  including  all  the  relevant  costs  associated  with  the      implementation  of  the  operational  plan,  and  also  potential  losses  stemming  from  NPE      workout  activities.      	1
      56.The NPE strategy should be fully embedded in the risk management framework. In that      	      context,  special  attention  should  be  paid  to:              	1
      57.Credit institutions should ensure a high level of monitoring and oversight by the risk      	      management  functions  in  respect  of  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the  NPE  strategy      and  operational  plan.      	1
58.In order for credit institutions to be able to address their NPE issues in an efficient and       sustainable manner, an	appropriate  governance  structure  and  operational  set-up  should  be              in  place.  	1
   59.This section sets out the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE       workout	framework,  covering  aspects  related  to  steering  and  decision-making,  the  NPE              operating  model,  the  internal  control  framework  and  NPE  monitoring  processes.          	1
   60.In the implementation of their NPE governance and operations, credit institutions should       take into account relevant consumer	protection  considerations  and  requirements,  and              ensure  fair  treatment  of  consumers.  	1
61.The overarching strategy of a credit institution and its implementation should cover the NPE       strategy and operational plan, which should	therefore  be  set,  approved  and  reviewed  by  the              management  body.  In  particular,  the  management  body  should:    	1
   62.The management body and senior management should dedicate an amount of their capacity       and devote sufficient time	to  NPE  workout-related  matters  in  line  with  Article  76  of              Directive  2013/36/EU,  in  proportion  to  the  risks  connected  to  NPEs  within  the  credit              institution.  Credit  institutions  should  establish  and  document  clearly  defined,  efficient  and              consistent  decision-making  procedures,  with  adequate  second  line  of  defence  involvement              at  all  times.    	1
   63.In order to mitigate sufficiently any conflict of interest in managing NPEs, as well as to make      	good  use  of  dedicated  NPE  expertise  across  the  organisation,  credit  institutions  should              establish  dedicated  NPE  workout  units  (NPE  WUs)  that  are  independent  from  loan  origination              activities.  This  separation  of  duties  approach  should  encompass  not  only  client  relationship              activities  (e.g.  negotiation  of  forbearance  solutions  with  clients)  but  also  the  decision-making              process.  In  this  context,  credit  institutions  should  consider  implementing  dedicated  decisionmaking  bodies  related  to  NPE  workout  (e.g.  an  NPE  committee).  	1
   64.Where overlaps with the decision-making bodies, managers or experts involved in the loan       origination process are unavoidable,	the  institutional  framework  and  internal  controls  should              ensure  that  any  potential  conflicts  of  interest  are  sufficiently  mitigated.  	1
   65.Credit institutions should have arrangements in place to ensure that regular feedback       between loan origination units and	NPE  WUs  is  established.            	1
   66.When designing an appropriate NPE WU structure, credit institutions should take into       account the specificities of their	main  NPE  portfolios,  including  the  type  of  exposure  (retail,              SME,  corporate)  and  the  type  of  collateral.    	1
   67.Credit institutions should consider designing automated processes for NPE WUs for       homogeneous retail NPE portfolios. For corporate	NPE  portfolios,  where  relevant,  and              depending  on  the  sectoral  concentration  of  the  NPEs,  credit  institutions  should  consider  a              relationship  management  approach  with  sectoral  specialisation  of  NPE  WU  staff.  For  sole              traders  and  micro-enterprises,  a  combination  of  automated  elements  and  a  relationship              management  approach  should  be  considered.      	1
   68.Smaller and less complex credit institutions (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3       or 4)	may  have  in  place  dedicated  workout  functions  proportionate  to  their  size,  nature,              complexity  and  risk  profile.  Credit  institutions  should  ensure  that  the  design  of  such  functions              prevents  and  eliminates  conflict  of  interest  in  the  management  of  NPEs.      	1
   69.For proportionality purposes, smaller and less complex credit institutions (e.g. those that are       classified in SREP Category	3  or  4),  as  an  alternative  to  establishing  dedicated  decision-              	1
      70.NPE WUs should be set up to ensure that NPE workout activities and borrower engagements     	        are  tailored  to  the  phases  of  the  NPE  life  cycle.22  Credit  institutions  should  set  up  different      NPE  WUs  for  the  different  phases  of  the  NPE  life  cycle  and  also  for  different  portfolios,  if      appropriate.  All  applicable  workout  stages  should  receive  adequate  focus  and  should  be      equipped  with  sufficiently  specialised  staff.            	1
      71.Credit institutions should consider the following phases in the NPE life cycle, taking into      	      account  also  the  specificities  of  the  products  and  the  nature  of  the  arrears:  	1
     72.Managing foreclosed assets (or other assets stemming from NPEs): collateral repossession   generally commences	after  other  attempts  by  the  credit  institution  to  collect  the  outstanding    amounts  have  failed.  The  credit  institution  should  have  a  policy  in  place  that  describes  the    recovery  process  for  foreclosed  assets,  covering  in  particular  the  steps  of  repossession,    valuation  of  the  collateral  and  realisation  of  various  types  of  collateral  through  appropriate    means.      	1
     73.The EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit  	losses25  describe  the  policies  for  credit  institutions  of  grouping  exposures  with  shared  credit    risk  characteristics.  Homogeneous  portfolios  should  be  built  up  in  order  to  tailor  treatments    specifically  to  NPEs.  Credit  institutions  should  consider  designing  customised  processes  for    each  portfolio,  with  a  dedicated  expert  team  taking  ownership  of  each.  NPE  portfolios  should    be  analysed  with  a  high  degree  of  granularity,  resulting  in  clearly  defined  borrower    subportfolios.  For  these  analyses,  credit  institutions  should  develop  appropriate    management  information  systems  and  sufficiently  high  data  quality.              	1
     74.A list of potential selection criteria for grouping retail NPEs into portfolios is contained in      	    Annex  1.            	1
     75.For corporate NPE portfolios, grouping by asset class or sector (e.g. commercial real estate,       	  land  and  development,  shipping,  trading  businesses)  should  be  considered  a  key  driver  for    NPE  WU  specialisation.  These  portfolios  should  then  be  further  divided  in  line  with  the  NPE    strategy  and  the  level  of  financial  difficulty  to  ensure  that  workout  activities  are  sufficiently    focused.          	1
     76.Credit institutions should have in place an appropriate organisational framework relative to   their	business  model  and  taking  into  account  their  risks,  including  risks  stemming  from  NPEs.    Credit  institutions  therefore  should  devote  an  appropriate  and  proportionate  amount  of    management  attention  and  resources  to  the  workout  of  NPEs  and  to  internal  controls  on    related  processes.    	1
     77.Sharing management and resources with other parts of the value chain (e.g. loan origination)       	  should  be  carefully  reviewed  before  implementation  in  order  to  avoid  conflicts  of  interest    and  to  ensure  sufficient  specialisation,  as  discussed  above.  	1
     78.Based on the findings of the credit institution’s NPE self-assessment on capabilities, as  	referred  to  in  section  4.2.1,  credit  institutions  should  regularly  review  the  adequacy  of  their    internal  and  external  NPE  workout  resources  and  address  any  human  resourcing  gaps  in  a    timely  fashion.  As  workout  activities  may  place  significant  demands  on  resources,  credit    institutions  should  consider  if  it  is  appropriate  to  choose  to  use  fixed-term  contracts,    internal/external  outsourcing  or  joint  ventures  for  NPE  workout  activities.  However,  the  final    responsibility  for  these  activities  remains  with  the  credit  institution.  In  the  event  that    outsourcing  is  used,  credit  institutions  should  ensure  that  such  outsourcing  is  arranged  in    accordance  with  the  applicable  legislation  or  regulatory  requirements.    	1
     79.Credit institutions should build up the relevant expertise required for the defined NPE  	operating  model,  including  the  NPE  WUs  and  internal  control  functions,  in  line  with  the    provisions  of  the  joint  ESMA  and  EBA  Guidelines  on  the  assessment  of  the  suitability  of    members  of  the  management  body  and  key  function  holders.26  Staff  allocated  to  key  NPE    workout  tasks  should  have  specific  NPE  expertise  and  experience.  Credit  institutions  should    implement  adequate  and  dedicated  NPE  training,  including  on  consumer  protection,  and    should  design  staff  development  plans  to  build  in-house  expertise  using  available  talent.        	1
     80.Where it is not possible or efficient to build in-house expertise and infrastructure, the NPE      	    WUs  should  have  easy  access  to  qualified  independent  external  resources  (e.g.  property    appraisers,  legal  advisors,  business  planners,  industry  experts)  or  to  dedicated  NPE  servicing    companies.    	1
     81.The credit institution, in alignment with the overall NPE strategy and operational plan, should       	  implement  an  appraisal  system  tailored  to  the  requirements  of  the  NPE  WUs.  The  appraisal    system  should  be  designed  in  line  with  the  provisions  of  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  sound              	1
     82.The performance measurement framework for the management body and relevant   managers should include	specific  indicators  linked  to  the  targets  defined  in  the  credit    institution’s  NPE  strategy  and  operational  plan.  The  weights  given  to  these  indicators  within    the  overall  performance  measurement  framework  should  be  proportionate  to  the  severity    of  the  NPE  issues  faced  by  the  credit  institution.            	1
     83.Addressing early warnings signals and indicators should be encouraged by credit institutions   through	the  remuneration  policy  and  incentives  framework  in  order  to  ensure  that  prearrears  are  efficiently  addressed  and  NPE  inflows  thus  effectively  reduced.      	1
     84.In terms of adequate technical infrastructure, credit institutions should ensure that all NPErelated data are centrally stored in robust and secure	IT  systems  and  that  they  are  complete    and  up  to  date  throughout  the  NPE  workout  process.              	1
     85.An adequate technical    	 infrastructure should enable NPE WUs to:  	1
      86.The adequacy of the technical infrastructure, including data quality, should be assessed by       	    an  independent  internal  or  external  audit  function  on  a  regular  basis.        	1
87.The management body should be responsible for establishing and monitoring the adequacy    and effectiveness of the internal	control  framework.  In  particular,  effective  and  efficient      internal  control  processes  should  be  implemented  for  the  NPE  workout  framework  in  order      to  ensure  full  alignment  between  the  NPE  strategy  and  operational  plan  on  the  one  hand  and      the  credit  institution’s  overall  business  strategy,  including  the  NPE  strategy  and  operational      plan,  and  risk  appetite  on  the  other  hand.    	1
      88.Internal control functions should regularly submit to the management body written reports  	  on  NPE  management  highlighting  major  identified  deficiencies.  These  reports  should  include,      for  each  new  identified  major  deficiency,  the  relevant  risks  involved,  an  impact  assessment,      recommendations  and  corrective  measures  to  be  taken.  Where  necessary,  the  heads  of      internal  control  functions  should  be  able  to  have  access  to  and  report  directly  to  the      management  body  in  its  supervisory  function  to  raise  concerns  and  warn  the  supervisory      function,  where  appropriate,  when  specific  developments  affect  or  may  affect  the      institution.  This  should  not  prevent  the  heads  of  internal  control  functions  from  reporting      within  regular  reporting  lines  as  well.            	1
      89.The management body should follow up on the findings of the internal control functions in a    	          timely  and  effective  manner  and  require  adequate  remedial  actions.  A  formal  follow-up      procedure  on  findings  and  corrective  measures  taken  should  be  put  in  place.              	1
      90.The internal control framework should involve all three lines of defence in line with the EBA    	          Guidelines  on  internal  governance.30  The  roles  of  the  different  functions  involved  should  be      assigned  and  documented  clearly  to  avoid  gaps  or  overlaps.  Key  outcomes  of  second-  and      third-line  activities  as  well  as  defined  mitigating  actions  and  progress  on  those  needs  should      be  reported  to  the  management  body  regularly.              	1
      91.In the implementation of the control framework, larger and more complex credit institutions       	    should  apply  all  three  lines  of  defence;  the  second  line  of  defence  does  not  have  to  be  NPE      specific  and  may  be  performed  by  the  credit  risk  (control)  function.          	1
      92.In the implementation of the control framework, smaller and less complex credit institutions       	    (e.g.  those  that  are  classified  in  SREP  Category  3  or  4)  do  not  necessarily  have  to  have  three      fully  fledged  NPE-specific  lines  of  defence,  but  they  have  to  ensure  that  any  conflict  of      interest  is  sufficiently  mitigated.    	1
   93.Credit institutions should ensure that the first line of defence is embedded into the       procedures and processes	of  the  operational  units,  mainly  the  NPE  WUs,  that  actually  own              and  manage  the  credit  institution’s  risks  in  the  specific  context  of  NPE  workout.  	1
   94.In order to ensure that adequate control mechanisms are implemented, credit institutions       should have internal policies in	place  on  the  NPE  workout  framework.  The  managers  of  the              operational  units  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  these  internal  policies  are  implemented,              including  through  their  incorporation  into  IT  procedures.  Annex  4  to  these  guidelines  sets  out              key  elements  of  NPE  framework-related  policies  that  should  be  implemented  in  credit              institutions.              	1
   95.Second line of defence functions should perform controls on a continuous basis to check that       NPE management	in  the  first  line  of  defence  is  operating  as  intended.  To  adequately  perform              their  control  tasks,  second-line  functions  require  a  strong  degree  of  independence  from              functions  performing  business  activities,  including  the  NPE  WUs,  and  should  have  sufficient              resources.  They  should  have  an  adequate  number  of  qualified  staff.  The  qualifications  of  staff              should  be  reassessed  on  an  ongoing  basis,  and  staff  should  receive  training  as  necessary.          	1
   96.The second line of defence controls the implementation of risk management measures by       the NPE WUs and	should  have  a  special  focus  on:        	1
   97.Risk control and compliance functions should also provide guidance on the process of       designing and reviewing NPE-related	policies  and  procedures  and  on  the  controls  being              established  across  NPE  WUs.  These  functions  should  be  involved  in  the  design  and  review  of              the  policies  before  they  are  approved  by  the  management  body.              	1
   98.The third line of defence, the independent internal audit function, should have sufficient NPE       workout expertise to	perform  its  periodic  control  activities  on  the  efficiency  and              effectiveness  of  the  NPE  framework,  including  the  first-  and  second-line  controls.          	1
   99.With regard to the NPE framework, the internal audit function should, at least, perform       regular assessments to	monitor  adherence  to  internal  NPE-related  policies  (see  Annex  4)  and              to  this  guidance.  This  should  also  include  random  and  unannounced  inspections  and  credit              file  reviews.  	1
   100. In determining the frequency, scope and scale of the controls to be carried out, credit       institutions	should  take  into  account  the  level  of  NPEs  and  whether  significant  irregularities              and  weaknesses  have  been  identified  by  recent  audits.          	1
   101. Based on the results of its controls, the internal audit function should make       recommendations to the	management  body,  bringing  possible  improvements  to  their              attention.      	1
102. The monitoring systems should be based on the NPE targets approved in the NPE strategy       and related operational plan,	which  are  subsequently  cascaded  down  to  the  operational              targets  of  the  NPE  WUs,  with  feedback  loops  to  pricing  of  credit  risk  and  provisioning.  A              related  framework  of  NPE-related  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  should  be  developed  to              allow  the  management  body  and  other  relevant  managers  to  measure  progress.  	1
   103. Credit institutions should define and monitor NPE-related KPIs. The NPE-related KPIs,       should include, but not necessarily	be  limited  to  (see  also  Annex  2):      	1
   104. Credit institutions should closely monitor the relative and absolute levels of NPEs and FBEs,       as well	as  foreclosed  assets  (or  other  assets  stemming  from  NPE  activities)  and  early  arrears,              in  their  books.    	1
   105. Credit institutions should carry out such monitoring activities at transaction/borrower       level, and portfolio or subportfolio levels,	as  appropriate,  considering  aspects  such  as              business  line,  borrower  segment,  geographical  area,  products,  concentration  risk,  level  of              collateralisation  and  type  of  collateral  provided,  and  debt-service  ability.              	1
   106. Credit institutions should monitor the level of impairments of NPEs in order to provide the       management	body  with  comprehensive  information  on  coverage.  The  analysis  should              include  data  on  the  aggregate  level  as  well  as  the  levels  for  different  NPE  portfolios.  The              selection  of  NPE  portfolios  should  consider  aspects  such  as  type  of  exposure,  including              secured/unsecured,  type  of  collateral  and  guarantees,  geographical  area,  number  of  years              since  NPE  classification,  time  to  recovery,  and  the  use  of  the  going  and  gone  concern              approach.  Coverage  movements  should  also  be  monitored  and  reductions  clearly  explained.      	1
   107. Credit institutions should benchmark indicators related to the NPE ratio and coverage       against the available indicators	of  peers  in  order  to  provide  the  management  body  with  a              clear  picture  of  the  competitive  position  and  potential  shortcomings.          	1
   108. Credit institutions should monitor their deviations from the budget, in order for the       management body to	understand  the  drivers  of  significant  deviations  from  the  plan.  	1
   109. Key figures on NPE inflows and outflows should be included in periodic reporting to the       management	body,  including  transfers  from/to  NPEs,  non-performing  FBEs,  NPEs  under              probation,  performing  FBEs  and  early  arrears  (≤  90  days  past  due).          	1
   110. Credit institutions should consider if it would be useful to establish migration matrices to       track the	flow  of  exposures  into  and  out  of  non-performing  classification.  	1
   111. Credit institutions should estimate the migration rates and the quality of the performing       exposures month by	month,  so  that  actions  can  be  prioritised  and  taken  promptly  to  inhibit              deterioration  of  portfolio  quality.  Migration  matrices  can  be  further  broken  down  by              exposure  type  (retail  mortgage,  consumer,  real  estate),  by  business  unit  or  by  other              subportfolio  to  identify  whether  the  driver  of  the  flows  can  be  attributed  to  a  specific              subportfolio.      	1
   112. In their monitoring activities, credit institutions should use internal information (e.g. from       internal score systems) and	external  information  (e.g.  from  rating  agencies,  credit  bureaus,              specialised  sector  research  or  macroeconomic  indicators  for  specific  geographical  areas)  and              should  refer  to  a  particular  point  in  time  or  observation  period.  Annex  3  includes  examples              of  such  internal  and  external  information.  	1
   113. Once NPE WUs have been established, key operational performance metrics should be       implemented to assess the	units’  or  employees’  efficiency  relative  to  average  performance              and/or  standard  benchmark  indicators.  If  no  such  indicators  exist  or  are  available,  key        	1
     114. To resolve or limit the impact of NPEs, credit institutions should explore the possibilities      	    with  regard  to  granting  forbearance  measures.  Credit  institutions  should  monitor  two    aspects  of  the  forbearance  activities,  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  Section  7  specifies  the    requirements  relating  to  the  application  of  forbearance  measures.      	1
     115. The main objective of forbearance measures should be the return of the borrower to a     	      sustainable  performing  repayment  status,  taking  into  account  the  amount  due  and    minimising  expected  losses.  This  objectives  should  take  into  account  the  importance  of    ensuring  the  fair  treatment  of  consumers  and  compliance  with  any  consumer  protection    requirements  that  may  be  applicable.  The  credit  institution  should  monitor  the  quality  of  the    forbearance  activities  to  make  sure  that  they  are  not  used  to  delay  impairments  or  an    assessment  that  the  exposure  is  uncollectable.  The  monitoring  should  cover  forbearance    activities  in  relation  to  both  performing  and  non-performing  exposures.  	1
     116. If no sustainable restructuring solution can be reached, credit institutions should still  	resolve  the  NPE.  Resolution  may  involve  initiating  legal  procedures,  foreclosing  assets,  debt    to  asset/equity  swap,  disposal  of  credit  facilities  by  sale,  transferal  to  an  asset  management    company  or  securitisation.  Where  the  price  obtained  from  the  foreclosure  of  immovable    property  affects  the  amount  owed  by  a  consumer,  credit  institutions  should  take  into    account,  when  deciding  on  the  liquidation  measure  and  next  steps,  the  provisions  of    Article  17(5)  of  Directive  2014/17/EU,31  to  the  extent  applicable.    	1
     117. Liquidation activities should be monitored by the credit institution to help inform strategies       	  and  policies.  Credit  institutions  should  monitor  disposals  and  monitor  realised  sales/transfer    prices  against  net  carrying  amounts.            	1
     118. Credit institutions should monitor the volumes and recovery rates of legal and foreclosure       	  cases.  Performance  in  this  regard  should  be  measured  against  set  targets,  in  terms  of  number    of  months/years  and  loss  to  the  institution.  In  monitoring  the  actual  loss  rate,  institutions  are    expected  to  build  historical  time  series  for  each  loan  portfolio  to  back  up  the  assumptions    used  for  impairment  review  purposes  and  stress  test  exercises.  	1
     119. For exposures covered by collateral or another type of guarantee, credit institutions should       	  monitor  the  time  period  needed  to  liquidate  the  collateral  or  to  enforce  a  guarantee.  Credit    institutions  should  also  monitor  potential  forced  sale  haircuts  upon  liquidation  and      	1
   120. Monitoring the recovery rates from foreclosure and other legal proceedings should help       credit institutions to reliably	assess  whether  the  decision  to  foreclose  will  provide  a  higher              net  present  value  than  pursuing  a  forbearance  option.  The  data  regarding  the  recovery  rates              from  foreclosures  should  be  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  feed  into  potential              amendments  to  credit  institutions’  strategies  for  handling  their  debt  recovery/legal              portfolios.  	1
   121. Credit institutions should also monitor the average duration of legal procedures recently       completed and the average	amounts  recovered  (including  related  recovery  costs)  from  these              completed  procedures.  	1
   122. Credit institutions should carefully monitor cases where the debt is swapped with an asset       or equity	of  the  borrower,  at  least  by  using  volume  indicators  by  type  of  assets,  and  ensure              compliance  with  any  limits  set  by  the  relevant  national  regulations  on  holdings.  The  use  of              this  approach  as  a  forbearance  measure  should  be  backed  by  a  proper  business  plan  and              limited  to  assets  in  relation  to  which  the  institution  has  sufficient  expertise  and  the  market              realistically  allows  the  determined  value  to  be  extracted  from  the  asset  in  the  short  to              medium  term.  The  institution  should  also  make  sure  that  the  valuation  of  the  assets  is  carried              out  by  qualified  and  experienced  appraisers.      	1
   123. Credit institutions should monitor and report to their management bodies the amount of       interest income stemming	from  NPEs.  In  addition,  a  distinction  should  be  made  between  the              interest  payments  on  NPEs  actually  received  and  those  not  actually  received.  The  evolution              of  loss  allowances  and  the  related  drivers  should  also  be  monitored.          	1
   124. If foreclosure is a part of a credit institution’s NPE strategy, it should also monitor the      	volume,  ageing,  coverage  and  flows  of  foreclosed  assets  (or  other  assets  stemming  from              NPEs)  at  a  sufficient  level  of  granularity  to  take  into  account  material  types  of  assets.  The              performance  of  the  foreclosed  assets  vis-a-vis  the  predefined  business  plan  should  be              monitored  and  reported  to  the  management  body  and  other  relevant  managers  on  an              aggregate  level.              	1
125. Credit institutions should use the definitions of forbearance measures and FBEs as stated    in Annex V	to  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014  in  their  risk      management.  Forbearance  measures  should  aim  to  return  the  borrower  to  a  sustainable      performing  repayment  status,  taking  into  account  the  amount  due  and  minimising  expected      losses.  When  deciding  on  which  steps  or  forbearance  measures  to  take,  credit  institutions      should  take  into  account  the  interests  of  consumers  and  comply  with  consumer  protection      requirements,  including  those  set  out  in  Article  28  of  Directive  2014/17/EU32  and  in  the  EBA      Guidelines  on  arrears  and  foreclosure.33  Credit  institutions  should  monitor  the  efficiency  and      effectiveness  of  forbearance  activities.      	1
127. Credit institutions should consider using a combination of different forbearance measures,    including both short-term and long-term	time  horizons  in  line  with  the  nature  and  maturity      of  the  credit  facilities.  Credit  institutions  should  consider  the  list  of  possible  forbearance      measures  in  Annex  5.  	1
      128. Credit institutions should use forbearance measures with time horizons shorter than two       	    years  (one  year  in  the  case  of  project  finance  and  the  construction  of  commercial  property)      where  such  measures  do  not  address  the  resolution  of  outstanding  arrears,  unless  such      measures  are  combined  with  forbearance  measures  that  are  longer  than  two  years.            	1
      129. Credit institutions should consider forbearance measures with time horizons not greater  	  than  two  years  (and,  where  appropriate,  for  other  forbearance  measures)  when  the      borrower  meets  the  following  criteria:        	1
   130. The contractual terms for any forbearance measure should ensure that the credit       institution has the right	to  review  the  agreed  forbearance  measures  if  the  situation  of  the              borrower  improves  and  more  favourable  conditions  for  the  credit  institution  (with  regard  to              the  forbearance  or  the  original  contractual  conditions)  can  therefore  be  enforced;  to  this              end,  the  contract  should  indicate  the  specific  changes  to  the  forbearance  measure  to  be              applied  as  a  consequence  of  specific  improvements  in  the  situation  of  the  borrower.  Credit              institutions  should  also  consider  including  strict  consequences,  such  as  a  requirement  for              additional  collateral,  in  the  contractual  terms  for  borrowers  who  fail  to  comply  with  the              forbearance  agreement.  	1
   131. Credit institutions should distinguish between viable forbearance measures contributing to       reducing the borrower’s exposure and non-viable	forbearance  measures.  	1
   132. Credit institutions should consider the following factors when assessing	 the viability of       forbearance measures:  	1
   133. The assessment of viability should be based on the financial characteristics of the borrower       and the	forbearance  measure  to  be  granted  at  that  time.  The  viability  assessment  should          	1
   134. Credit institutions should develop a policy on their forbearance ac	tivities. The policy should       cover at least:	1
   135. Credit institutions should regularly review their forbearance policies and options based on       the collective monitoring of	the  performance  of  different  forbearance  measures,  including              the  examination  of  potential  causes  and  instances  of  re-defaults.    	1
   136. Credit institutions should monitor the quality of forbearance activities to make sure that       they are not	used  to  delay  an  assessment  that  the  exposure  is  uncollectable.  The  monitoring              should  cover  forbearance  activities  relating  to  both  performing  and  non-performing              exposures  and  differentiate  between  types  of  forbearance  measures  and  portfolios.  	1
   137. Credit institutions should measure the efficiency of the process for granting forbearance       measures and monitor the	duration  of  the  decision-making  process  and  the  volumes  of              forbearance  measures  at  each  stage  of  the  granting  process.              	1
   138. Credit institutions should monitor effectiveness of forbearance measures granted. This       monitoring should measure the degree of	success  of  the  forbearance  measure  and  whether              the  modified  contractual  obligations  of  the  borrower  are  met  and  the  exposure  is              performing.  The  following  metrics  by  portfolio  and  by  type  of  forbearance  measure  should              be  used:            	1
   139. Credit institutions should monitor indicators relating to forbearance activities using a       meaningful breakdown, which could include	the  type  and  duration  of  arrears,  the  type  of              exposure,  the  probability  of  recovery,  the  size  of  the  exposures  or  the  total  amount  of              exposures  to  the  same  borrower  or  group  of  connected  clients,  and  the  number  of              forbearance  solutions  applied  in  the  past.        	1
   140. Before granting any forbearance measures, credit institutions should assess the borrower’s       repayment capacity. This should include	an  adequate  assessment  of  the  borrower’s  financial              situation,  based  on  sufficient  information  and  taking  into  account  relevant  factors  such  as              the  debt-servicing  capacity  and  overall  indebtedness  of  the  borrower  or  the              property/project.    	1
   141. Credit institutions should have adequate policies and procedures in place with a range of       sustainable and	effective  solutions  for  the  borrower  when  granting  forbearance.  The              grouping  of  exposures  into  portfolios  should  be  reflected  in  these  policies  and  procedures,              to  enable  credit  institutions  to  adopt  different  forbearance  measures  for  different  segments              of  borrowers  and  tailor  measures  to  them.              	1
   142. Credit institutions should consider developing decision trees and standardised forbearance       measures for portfolios of homogeneous borrowers	with  less  complex  exposures.  Decision              trees  may  help  in  determining  and  implementing  appropriate  and  sustainable  forbearance              strategies  for  specific  portfolios  of  borrowers  in  a  consistent  manner  based  on  approved              criteria.        	1
   143. Credit institutions should use a net present value approach to determine the most suitable       and sustainable	workout  option  for  borrowers’  varied  circumstances,  having  regard  to  the              fair  treatment  of  the  consumer,  and  should  compare  the  net  present  value  of  the  envisaged              forbearance  measure  with  the  net  present  value  of  repossession  and  other  available      	1
     144. Forbearance contracts and documentation should include a well-defined borrower target   schedule, detailing	all  necessary  targets  to  be  achieved  by  the  borrower  in  order  to  repay  the    exposure  over  the  course  of  the  contract  term.  These  milestones/targets  should  be  credible,    be  appropriately  conservative  and  take  account  of  any  potential  deterioration  in  the    borrower’s  financial  situation.  The  performance  of  the  forborne  borrower,  including  the    borrower’s  compliance  with  all  agreed  targets,  should  be  closely  monitored  by  the  NPE  WU    responsible  for  granting  the  forbearance,  at  least  for  the  duration  of  the  probation  period.        	1
145. Credit institutions should use the definition of NPE in Annex V to Commission Implementing   Regulation (EU) No	680/2014  in  their  risk  management.          	1
     146. This section sets out the key elements of governance and operations in relation to NPE     	      recognition.            	1
147. Credit institutions should recognise exposures as being past due in accordance with   section 4 of the EBA	Guidelines  on  the  application  of  the  definition  of  default  34  and    Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2018/171  on  the  materiality  threshold  for  credit    obligations  past  due.35        	1
148. Credit institutions should recognise exposures as unlikely to pay and identify indications of   unlikeliness to pay in	accordance  with  section  5  of  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  the  application  of    the  definition  of  default.              	1
     149. Credit institutions should monitor the repayment capacity of borrowers. In the case of       	  corporate  borrowers,  this  should  be  assessed  at  least  annually  and  at  key  reporting  dates  at  	1
   150. For the purpose of implementing forbearance measures, credit institutions should be able       to identify signs of	possible  future  financial  difficulties  at  an  early  stage.  In  order  to  do  so,  the              assessment  of  the  financial  situation  of  the  borrower  should  not  be  limited  to  exposures  with              apparent  signs  of  financial  difficulties.  An  assessment  of  financial  difficulties  should  also  be              conducted  for  exposures  with  regard  to  which  the  borrower  does  not  have  apparent  financial              difficulties  but  in  relation  to  which  market  conditions  have  changed  significantly  in  a  way  that              could  impact  the  borrower’s  ability  to  repay  (e.g.  bullet  loans  the  repayment  of  which  will              depend  on  the  sale  of  immovable  property  or  foreign  currency  loans).      	1
   151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on      	the  situation  of  the  borrower  only,  disregarding  collateral  or  any  guarantees  provided  by              third  parties.  When  assessing  the  financial  difficulties  of  the  borrower,  credit  institutions,  in              accordance  with  Annex  V  to  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014,  should              consider  at  least  the  following  rebuttable  circumstances:      	1
   152. Exposures should not be identified as forborne when concessions are made to borrowers       who are not	in  financial  difficulties.  Credit  institutions  should  distinguish,  based  on  a  detailed              financial  assessment,  between  renegotiations  or  rollovers  granted  to  borrowers  not  in              financial  difficulties  and  forbearance  measures  such  as  concessions  granted  to  borrowers  in            	1
   153. Granting new conditions such as a new interest rate more favourable than the rate       borrowers with	a  similar  risk  profile  could  obtain  may  be  considered  an  indication  of  such  a              concession  when  the  credit  institution  determines  that  the  reason  for  the  new  rate  is  the              financial  difficulties  of  the  borrower.  The  provision  of  more  favourable  new  conditions  than              those  practised  by  the  market  should  not  be  considered  a  prerequisite  for  the  identification              of  concessions  and  therefore  forbearance.  In  line  with  Annex  V  to  Commission  Implementing              Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014,  when  a  borrower  is  in  financial  difficulties,  a  change  in              conditions  in  line  with  what  other  borrowers  with  a  similar  risk  profile  could  get  from  the              credit  institution  should  qualify  as  a  concession,  including  when  borrowers  are  included  in              public  forbearance  schemes  that  are  offered  by  credit  institutions.    	1
   154. Borrowers may request modifications in the contractual conditions of their loans without       facing or being about	to  face  difficulties  in  meeting  their  financial  commitments.  Credit              institutions  should  perform  an  assessment  of  the  borrower’s  financial  situation  when  such              modifications  to  contractual  conditions  have  an  impact  on  payment  performance.    	1
   155. When granting forbearance measures to performing exposures, credit institutions should       assess whether these measures lead to	a  need  to  reclassify  the  exposure  as  non-performing.              Granting  forbearance  measures  to  NPEs  does  not  clear  their  non-performing  status:  the              exposures  should  continue  to  be  identified  as  non-performing  for  at  least  one  year  of  the  cure              period  after  the  granting  of  the  forbearance  measures,  as  specified  in  Annex  V  to  Commission              Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014  and  in  section  7.3.3.      	1
   156. When assessing if FBEs should be classified as non-performing, 	credit institutions should       assess if exposures: 	1
   157. Credit institutions should reclassify NPEs, including FBEs, as performing in accordance with       Annex V to Commission	Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014.  Credit  institutions              should  perform  a  financial  analysis  of  the  borrower  to  establish  the  absence  of  concerns              regarding  the  borrower’s  ability  to  pay  its  credit  obligations.      	1
   158. Credit institutions’ policies for the reclassification of non-performing FBEs should specify       practices for dispelling concerns regarding	the  borrower’s  ability  to  comply  with  the  postforbearance  conditions  set  out  in  Annex  V  to  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)              No  680/2014.  These  policies  should  establish  criteria  in  terms  of  payments  made  during  the              cure  period  of  at  least  one  year  and  define  the  borrower’s  ability  to  comply  with  postforbearance  conditions  (to  the  extent  that  full  repayment  of  the  debt  is  likely)  without  being              reliant  on  the  realisation  of  collateral  at  least  by  demonstrating  payments  of  a  not              insignificant  amount  of  principal.  These  policies  should  require  payments  of  both  principal              and  interest.  	1
   159. In addition, where a borrower has other exposures to a credit institution that are not the      	subject  of  a  forbearance  measure,  the  credit  institution  should  consider  the  impact  and  the              performance  of  these  exposures  in  its  assessment  of  the  borrower’s  ability  to  comply  with              post-forbearance  conditions.  The  consideration  of  arrears  should  not  change  the  level  of              application  of  non-performing  status,  in  accordance  with  Annex  V  to  Commission              Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014,  and  only  exposures  to  which  forbearance              measures  have  been  applied  should  be  identified  as  FBEs.              	1
   160. The existence of contract terms that extend the repayment period, such as grace periods       for the	principal,  should  confirm  the  classification  of  these  FBEs  as  non-performing  until  the              requirements  of  Annex  V  to  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014  have              been  satisfied.  The  fact  that  the  one-year  cure  period  has  elapsed  should  not  automatically              lead  to  reclassification  to  performing  unless  regular  payments  have  been  made  over  these        	1
   161. Once FBEs are classified as performing, either because they have met the conditions for       being reclassified	from  the  non-performing  category  or  because  the  granting  of  forbearance              measures  did  not  lead  to  the  classification  of  the  exposure  as  non-performing,  they  should              continue  to  be  identified  as  forborne  until  all  the  conditions  for  the  discontinuation  of  the              classification  of  exposures  as  forborne  under  paragraph  256  of  Annex  V  to  Commission              Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014  have  been  met.      	1
   162. Credit institutions’ policies for identifying performing FBEs should specify practices for       dispelling concerns regarding the borrower’s	financial  difficulties.  Credit  institutions’  policies              should  require  the  borrower  to  have  settled,  by  means  of  regular  payments,  an  amount  equal          	1
      163. In accordance with paragraph 260 of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)      	      No  680/2014,  new  forbearance  measures  granted  to  performing  FBEs  that  have  been      reclassified  out  of  the  non-performing  category  will  entail  the  reclassification  of  these      transactions  to  the  non-performing  category.  The  same  should  apply  when  these  exposures      become  more  than  30  days  past  due.              	1
164. Credit institutions should adopt adequate mechanisms and procedures, in accordance with    section 8 of the EBA	Guidelines  on  the  definition  of  default,  for  the  harmonised      implementation  of  the  definition  in  all  subsidiaries  and  branches.  This  will  ensure  that  the      identification  of  NPEs  is  consistent  at  entity  and  banking  group  levels.              	1
      165. Credit institutions’ policies should ensure consistent treatment of individual clients and  	  groups  of  connected  clients  as  defined  in  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  the  EBA  Guidelines      on  connected  clients36  and  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  the  definition  of  default.  Credit  institutions’      policies  should  also  ensure  a  consistent  assessment  of  the  underlying  legal  relationships      between  legal  entities  across  a  group  of  connected  clients.  In  view  of  possible  contagion,      credit  institutions  should,  whenever  feasible,  apply  a  group  perspective  when  assessing  the      status  of  a  borrower’s  exposure  as  non-performing,  unless  it  is  affected  by  isolated  disputes      that  are  unrelated  to  the  solvency  of  the  counterparty.            	1
      166. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on the definition of default, credit institutions      	      should  keep  a  register  of  all  classification  criteria.            	1
167. Credit institutions should estimate loss allowances for NPEs and FBEs subject to impairment   in accordance with the	EBA  Guidelines  on  credit  risk  management  practices  and  accounting    for  expected  credit  losses.      	1
     168. This section sets out the key elements of governance and operations in relation to NPE     	      impairment  measurement  and  write-offs.      	1
169. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting   for expected credit losses,37	uncollectability  should  be  recognised  in  the  appropriate  period    through  loss  allowances  or  write-offs.  When  the  credit  institution  has  no  reasonable    expectation  of  recovering  contractual  cash  flow  of  the  exposure  it  should  lead  to  a  partial  or    full  write-off  of  the  exposure  (IFRS  9.B3.2.16.r).            	1
     170. A write-off may be done before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have    	        been  concluded  in  full.  A  write-off  should  not  be  considered  to  mean  that  the  credit    institution  has  forfeited  the  legal  right  to  recover  the  debt;  a  credit  institution’s  decision  to    forfeit  the  legal  claim  on  the  debt  is  debt  forgiveness.            	1
     171. Write-offs constitute a de-recognition event (IFRS 9.5.4.4). If cash or other assets are       	  eventually  collected,  these  collections  should  be  directly  recognised  as  income  in  the    statement  of  profit  or  loss.          	1
     172. Credit institutions should maintain detailed records of all NPE write-offs performed on a       	  portfolio-level  basis.              	1
173. Credit institutions should include in their internal policies guidance on the timeliness of   impairments and write-offs, acknowledging	external  circumstances  and  factors  such  as    ongoing  judicial  procedures.  In  particular  for  exposures  or  parts  of  exposures  that  are  not    covered  by  collateral,  credit  institutions  should  consider  suitable  maximum  periods  for  full    impairment,  coverage  and  write-off.  For  parts  of  exposures  covered  by  collateral,  the    establishment  of  a  minimum  impairment  level  should  take  the  type  of  collateral  into  account.    Empirical  evidence  should  be  applied  when  calibrating  the  impairment  and  write-off  periods    referred  to  above.  When  assessing  the  recoverability  of  NPEs  and  in  determining  internal          	1
       a) Exposures with prolonged arrears: different thresholds may be appropriate for different       	      portfolios.  Credit  institutions  should  assess  the  recoverability  of  NPEs  if  the  borrower  has        been  in  arrears  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time.  If,  following  this  assessment,  it  is  concluded        that  there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  of  recovering  an  exposure  or  part  of  an  exposure,        a  full  or  partial  write-off  should  be  performed.    	1
       b) Exposures under an insolvency procedure: where the collateralisation of the exposure is      	        low,  legal  expenses  often  absorb  a  significant  portion  of  the  proceeds  from  the  bankruptcy        procedure,  and  therefore  estimated  recoveries  can  be  expected  to  be  very  low.          	1
       c) A partial write-off may be justified when there is evidence that the borrower is unable to  	  repay  the  amount  of  the  exposure  in  full,  meaning  that  there  is  a  reasonable  expectation        of  recovering  a  part  of  the  exposure.          	1
174. Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to sound policies, procedures and    controls for assessing and	measuring  loss  allowances  and  write-off  on  NPEs  in  accordance      with  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  credit  risk  management  practices  and  accounting  for  expected      credit  losses.  Credit  institutions  should  back-test  their  loss  allowance  estimations  against      actual  losses.        	1
      175. These methodologies should also include policies and procedures on write-offs and  	  recoveries  as  defined  in  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  credit  risk  management  practices  and      accounting  for  expected  credit  losses.  The  policy  on  write-offs  should  include  indicators  used      to  assess  expectations  of  recovery  and  detailed  information  on  those  exposures  that  have      been  written  off  but  are  still  subject  to  enforcement  activity.      	1
      176. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting      	      for  expected  credit  losses,  credit  institutions  should  have  in  place  common  processes,      systems,  tools  and  data.      	1
      177. A credit institution’s internal audit function should verify the methodologies used in       	    accordance  with  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  internal  governance.38              	1
178. This section sets out the key elements for collateral valuation of immovable	 and movable       property pledged for NPEs. 	1
   179. A credit institution should have in place a written policy and procedures governing the       valuation of	property  collateral.  The  policy  and  procedures  should  be  fully  aligned  with  the              credit  institution’s  RAF.      	1
   180. The policy and procedures should cover the valuation of all immovable and movable       property collateral irrespective	of  its  eligibility  for  prudential  purposes  in  accordance  with              the  requirements  of  Article  208  and  Article  210  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.      	1
   181. The policy and procedures should be approved by the management body and should be       reviewed at	least  on  an  annual  basis.          	1
   182. Credit institutions should monitor and review the valuations performed by internal or       external appraisers on a	regular  basis  as  set  out  in  this  section.    	1
   183. Credit institutions should develop and implement a robust internal quality assurance policy       and procedures for valuations	conducted  internally  and  externally,  considering  the  following:      	1
   184. In addition, the internal audit function should regularly review the consistency and quality       of the valuation	policy  and  procedures,  the  independence  of  the  appraiser  selection  process              and  the  appropriateness  of  the  valuations  carried  out  by  both  external  and  internal              appraisers.    	1
   185. Credit institutions should monitor the value of immovable property collateral on a frequent       basis and at	a  minimum  as  specified  in  Article  208(3)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.          	1
   186. Indexation or similar methods may be used to monitor the value of a collateral and identify      	the  collaterals  requiring  revaluation.  This  should  be  in  line  with  the  institution’s  policy  and              provided  that  the  collateral  to  be  assessed  is  susceptible  to  accurate  assessment  by  such              methods.        	1
   188. Valuations and revaluations of immovable property collateral should be performed on an       individual and a property-specific	basis.  Valuations  and  revaluations  of  immovable  property              collateral  should  not  be  carried  out  using  a  statistical  model  as  the  sole  means  of  undertaking              the  review  of  the  property  valuation.        	1
   189. Competent authorities should define a common threshold for the individual valuation and       revaluation of the collaterals	used  for  NPEs  by  an  independent  appraiser.  This  threshold              should  be  applicable  to  all  credit  institutions  in  the  authority’s  jurisdiction  and  should  be              publicly  disclosed.  	1
   190. All valuations of immovable property, including updated valuations, should be performed       by an independent and qualified	appraiser,  internal  or  external,  who  possesses  the  necessary              qualifications,  ability  and  experience  to  execute  a  valuation,  as  specified  in  Article  208(3)(b)              and  Article  229  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.        	1
   191. For the purposes of external appraisals, credit institutions should establish a panel of       independent and qualified	appraisers,  based  on  the  criteria  set  out  below.  The  appraisers’              	1
   192. Credit institutions should ensure that external appraisers on the panel have adequate and       valid professional indemnity	insurance.    	1
   193. The credit institution should ensure that each qualified	 appraiser on the panel:    	1
   194. A panel of appraisers should contain expertise in various areas of the property sector       appropriate to	the  lending  business  of  the  credit  institution  and  the  location  of  lending.          	1
   195. In order to mitigate any conflict of interest sufficiently, credit institutions should ensure       that all internal	and  external  appraisers  who  are  going  to  carry  out  the  actual  appraisal  of  a              given  property  and  their  first-degree  relatives  meet  the  following  requirements:  	1
   196. Credit institutions should ensure adequate rotation of appraisers, i.e. two sequential       individual valuations of the immovable	property  by  the  same  appraiser  should  result  in  the              rotation  of  the  appraiser,  resulting  in  the  appointment  of  either  a  different  internal  appraiser              or  a  different  external  appraisal  provider.        	1
197. For prudential purposes, credit institutions should update valuations of all secured       exposures in accordance with the requirements of Article	208(3)  and  Article  210(c)  of              Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.    	1
   198. The group of collaterals that are subject to individual valuations and revaluations on a       regular basis	should  be  updated  at  the  time  when  the  exposure  is  classified  as  nonperforming  and  at  least  annually  while  it  continues  to  be  classified  as  such.  Credit  institutions              should  make  sure  that,  for  the  collateral  subject  to  indexation  or  other  similar  methods,  the              indexation  is  updated  at  least  annually.            	1
   199. For properties with an updated individual valuation tha	t has taken place within the past  	1
   200. Credit institutions should carry out more frequent monitoring where the market is subject       to significant negative	changes  and/or  where  there  are  signs  of  significant  decline  in  the  value              of  the  individual  collateral.    	1
   201. Therefore, credit institutions should define criteria in their collateral valuation policy and       procedures for determining if	a  significant  decline  in  collateral  value  has  taken  place.  Where              possible,  these  will  include  quantitative  thresholds  for  each  type  of  collateral,  based  on  the              observed  empirical  data  and  any  relevant  qualitative  credit  institution  experience,  bearing  in              mind  relevant  factors  such  as  market  price  trends  or  the  opinion  of  independent  appraisers.          	1
   202. Credit institutions should have appropriate processes and systems in place to flag outdated       valuations and to	trigger  valuation  reports.              	1
   203. Credit institutions should have defined collateral valuation approaches for each collateral       product type; these should be	adequate  and  appropriate  for  the  type  of  collateral  in              question.  	1
   204. All immovable property collateral should be valued on the basis of market value or       mortgage lending	value,  as  specified  under  Article  229  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.              Movable  property  should  be  valued  at  its  market  value.          	1
   205. For movable property, credit institutions should, in accordance with the requirements of       Article 199(6) of Regulation	(EU)  No  575/2013,  periodically  assess  the  liquidity  of  the              property.  If  there  is  material  volatility  in  the  market  prices,  the  institution  should              demonstrate  that  the  valuation  of  the  collateral  is  sufficiently  conservative.  	1
     206. For movable property, credit institutions should, in accordance with the requirements of  	Article  210  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  conduct  a  sufficient  legal  review  confirming  the    enforceability  of  the  collateral,  including  an  assessment  of  the  legal  right  to  enforce  and    liquidate  the  collateral  in  the  event  of  default,  within  a  reasonable  timeframe.      	1
     207. Overall valuations based only on the discounted replacement cost should not be used. For      	    income-generating  properties,  a  market-comparable  or  discounted  cash  flow  approach  can    be  used.    	1
     208. Property collateral should be valued in accordance with applicable international, European   and	national  standards.39  	1
     209. Credit institutions should estimate discounted cash flow in a prudential manner and in line      	    with  applicable  accounting  standards.        	1
     210. Calculation of discounted cash	 flow should take into account cases where:   	1
     211. When the estimation is based on the assumption that the operating cash flow of the     	      borrower  will  continue,  including  cash  flow  being  received  from  the  collateral,  updated  and    reliable  information  on  cash  flow  is  required.              	1
     212. When the estimation is based on the assumption that the operating cash flow of the     	      borrower  will  cease,  the  future  sale  proceeds  from  collateral  execution  should  be  adjusted    to  take  into  account  the  appropriate  liquidation  costs  and  market  price  discount.    	1
     213. In addition to the above liquidation costs, a market price discount, if appropriate, should      	    be  applied  to  the  updated  valuation  as  outlined  below.            	1
     214. The property price at the time of liquidation should take into account current and expected     	      market  conditions.          	1
     215. Time-to-sale considerations in connection with the disposal of mortgaged properties   should also	be  included,  based  on  debt  enforcement  practices  and  experiences  from  judicial    proceedings  at  national  level  and  on  empirical  evidence,  and  back-tested  accordingly.  These              	1
   216. The execution of collateral may include both consensual and non-consensual	 (forced)       liquidation strategies.   	1
   217. The liquidation cost discount should reflect the manner of collateral execution, i.e. whether       it is consensual	or  non-consensual.  	1
   218. The market price discount should reflect the liquidity of the market and the liquidation       strategy. It	should  not  reflect  fire  sale  conditions  unless  the  anticipated  liquidation  strategy              actually  involves  a  fire  sale.    	1
   219. Credit institutions should apply adequate market price discounts for the purposes of IFRS 9       for the	calculation  of  regulatory  capital  and  for  risk  control  purposes.  A  market  price  discount              may  be  close  to  zero  only  for  highly  liquid  and  non-distressed  collateral  types  that  are  not              affected  by  any  significant  correlation  risks.          	1
   220. All credit institutions should develop their own liquidation cost and market price discount       assumptions based on	observed  empirical  evidence.  If  insufficient  empirical  evidence  is              available,  discount  assumptions  should  be  based  on,  at  a  minimum,  liquidity,  passage  of  time,              and  the  quality/ageing  of  the  appraisal.  If  a  credit  institution  faces  the  situation  of  a  frozen              property  market  and  only  a  small  number  of  properties  have  been  sold  or  the  sales  history              has  to  be  considered  insufficient,  a  more  conservative  market  price  discount  should  apply.      	1
221. In estimating cash flow from property collateral liquidation, credit institutions should use       appropriate and credible assumptions. In addition, credit	institutions  should  pay  attention  to              the  requirements  for  valuing  cash  flow  under  IFRS  13  on  fair  value  measurements.  In              particular,  financial  institutions  should  comply  with  the  following  requirements:          	1
   222. When using the value of collateral in assessing the recoverable amount of the exposure, at       least	the  following  should  be  documented:          	1
   223. When the observable market price is used to assess the recoverable amount of the       exposure, the	amount,  source  and  date  of  the  observable  market  price  should  also  be              documented.          	1
   224. Credit institutions should be able to substantiate the assumptions used when assessing the       recoverable amount by	providing  to  the  competent  authority,  if  requested,  details  on  the              property  market  value,  the  market  price  discount,  legal  and  selling  expenses  applied,  and  the              term  used  for  the  time  to  liquidation.  Credit  institutions  should  be  able  to  fully  justify  their              assumptions,  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively,  and  explain  the  drivers  of  their              expectations,  taking  past  and  current  experience  into  account.        	1
225. Credit institutions should demonstrate via sound back-testing that the assumptions used       when assessing the recoverable amount were reasonable and	grounded  in  observed              experience.  In  this  context,  credit  institutions  should  regularly  back-test  their  valuation              history  (last  valuation  before  the  exposure  was  classified  as  non-performing)  against  their              sales  history  (net  sales  price  of  collateral).  Depending  on  the  size  and  business  model  of  the              credit  institution,  it  should  differentiate  by  collateral  type,  valuation  model/approach,  type      	1
   226. Alternatively, credit institutions using the advanced internal ratings based (A-IRB) approach       may use secured loss given	default  (LGD)  to  determine  haircuts.          	1
227. Credit institutions should have databases of transactions to enable the proper assessment,       monitoring and control of credit risk, to	respond  to  requests  from  management  and              supervisors,  and  to  enable  the  provision  of  information  in  periodic  reports  and  other  timely              and  comprehensive  documentation.  In  particular,  databases  should  comply  with  the              following  requirements:    	1
   228. These databases should include all the relevant information on properties and other       collateral for the credit	institutions’  transactions  and  on  the  links  between  collateral  and              specific  transactions.              	1
229. Credit institutions should strongly consider classifying foreclosed assets as non-current       assets held for sale under IFRS 5. This accounting	treatment  implies  that  the  asset  must  be              available  for  immediate  sale  in  its  present  condition  (IFRS  5.7),  that  the  management  body              should  approve  an  individual  plan  to  sell  the  asset  within  a  short  timeframe  (normally  one              year)  and  that  an  active  sales  policy  should  be  pursued  (IFRS  5.8);  thus,  it  favours  recoveries.      	1
   230. Foreclosed assets received should be	 valued at the lower of:      	1
   231. When fair value is not obtained by reference to an active market but is based on a valuation    	    technique  (either  level  2  or  level  3),  some  adjustments  are  necessary,  in  particular  as  a  result              of  two  factors:    57  FINAL  REPORT  –  GUIDELINES  ON  MANAGEMENT  OF  NON-PERFORMING  AND  FORBORNE  EXPOSURES          	1
    b) The volume or level of activity of the markets in relation to these assets. The credit     	    institution’s  previous  experience  of  the  entity  in  realisations  and  of  the  differences  between  amounts  arrived  at  using  the  valuation  technique  and  the  final  amounts  obtained  in  realisations  should  be  incorporated  into  the  calculation.  The  assumptions  made  in  order  to  measure  this  adjustment  may  be  documented,  and  should  be  available  to  the  supervisor  on  request.  Illiquidity  discounts  may  be  considered.          	1
   232. When credit institutions’ foreclosed assets are still under construction and it is decided to       complete construction	before  selling  the  asset,  they  should  demonstrate  the  merits  of  such              a  strategy  and  the  cost  should  not  exceed  the  fair  value  less  costs  to  complete  and  sell  the              asset  taking  into  account  an  appropriate  illiquidity  discount  as  described  above.              	1
   233. When a foreclosed asset has exceeded the average holding period for similar assets for       which active	sales  policies  are  in  place,  credit  institutions  should  revise  the  illiquidity  discount              applied  in  the  valuation  process  described  above,  increase  it  accordingly.  In  these              circumstances,  the  credit  institution  should  refrain  from  recognising  write-backs/reversals  of              existing  accumulated  impairment  on  the  asset,  as  its  prolonged  presence  on  the  balance              sheet  provides  evidence  that  the  credit  institution  is  unable  to  sell  the  asset  at  an  increased              valuation.              	1
   234. The frequency of valuation of foreclosed assets and the applicable procedures should       follow the treatment of	immovable  property  as  set  out  in  sections  9.1.2  and  9.2.              	1
235. As part of their ongoing engagement with credit institutions under the SREP, competent       authorities should monitor the application of	these  guidelines  by  the  credit  institutions,  in              particular  the  development  and  implementation  of  NPE  strategies  and  related  governance              and  operational  frameworks  as  described  in  sections  4  and  5.  Competent  authorities’              assessments  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  whether  the  credit  institution’s  NPE              strategy:          	1
   236. If the competent authority concludes that the NPE strategy of a credit institution clearly       lacks one	or  more  of  the  elements  listed  in  points  (a)  to  (e)  of  paragraph  235  it  should  be              considered  a  serious  shortcoming  of  the  NPE  strategy.  In  this  case,  competent  authorities              should  require  the  immediate  revision  of  the  NPE  strategy.  	1
   237. If the outcome of the competent authority’s assessment is that the requirements of       point (a) to	(e)  of  paragraph  236  are  broadly  fulfilled  by  the  NPE  strategy,  but  some              deficiencies  are  identified,  the  competent  authority  should  ensure  that  credit  institutions              present  an  action  plan  on  how  to  address  the  deficiencies  and  establish  an  effective  and              timely  NPE  management  framework.          	1
   238. Competent authorities should apply supervisory evaluation proportionately, taking into       account the specificities of the institutions (e.g.	in  terms  of  size,  nature  and  complexity).  In              their  SREP  assessments  of  NPE  strategies  and  the  supporting  governance  and  operational              arrangements,  the  competent  authorities  should  consider  also  the  business  models  of  the              institutions,  in  particular  when  the  sole  business  of  the  institution  is  the  purchase  and  sale  of              NPEs.              	1
      239. Proportionality in terms of the supervisory assessment of the NPE strategy of a smaller and    	          less  complex  credit  institution  (e.g.  an  SREP  Category  3  or  4  institution40)  can  be  achieved  by      aligning  the  assessment  with  the  SREP  engagement  model,  which  ensures  a  risk-based      approach  to  supervision  and  takes  into  account  the  systemic  importance  of  global  and      domestic  institutions.          	1
      240. Competent authorities should challenge	 credit institutions’:       	1
      241. Considering the importance of early detection and prevention of deteriorating credit  	  quality,  competent  authorities  should  assess  whether  the  early  warning  mechanisms  are      implemented  in  the  credit  institutions’  internal  procedures.      	1
      242. Competent authorities should assess	 if credit institutions:      	1
   243. Competent authorities should ensure that credit institutions have appropriate written       policies and procedures in place regarding	the  valuation  of  property,  as  described  in              section  9.  In  particular,  competent  authorities  should  verify  that  these  policies  cover  all              immovable  and  movable  property  types  that  are  used  to  secure  credit  exposures,  the  criteria              for  the  application  of  individual  versus  indexed  valuation  and  the  requirements  with  regard  to              eligible  appraisers.            	1
   244. If credit institutions report material deviations from the operational plan in accordance       with section 4.4, competent	authorities  should  assess  whether  the  proposed  remediation              actions  are  sufficient  to  eliminate  the  deviation  from  the  plan.  The  competent  authority              should  require  further  actions  of  the  credit  institution  if  it  is  concerned  about  the              effectiveness  of  the  proposed  actions.    	1
   245. The requirements set out above regarding the supervisory evaluation of the management       of NPEs and FBEs	supplement  and  further  specify  the  assessment  of  NPEs  and  FBEs  as  part              of  credit  risk  management  put  forward  in  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  common  procedures  and              methodologies  for  the  SREP.  The  findings  of  this  supervisory  evaluation  would  feed  into  the              assessment  of  credit  risk  under  Title  6.2  of  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  common  procedures  and              methodologies  for  the  SREP  and  would  inform  credit  risk  scores.          	1
2.1. When establishing the provisional list, competent authorities should give priority to those      services that satisfy both criteria (i.e. in area	C  of  Figure  1).            	1
2.2. In a second step, since the criteria are not strictly cumulative, competent authorities should      also consider services that only satisfy	one  of  the  criteria  (i.e.  in  areas  A  or  B)  for  inclusion  in  the            provisional  list.      	1
2.3. Competent authorities should only use other criteria as an exception, for market-specific      issues. In doing so, competent authorities should be	able  to  justify  the  methodology  used,            supply  supporting  data  and  provide  the  reasoning  behind  their  decisions.      	1
2.4. Competent authorities should consider the service provided as a single service, irrespective of      the potential for providers to differentiate costs	according  to  factors  such  as  channels  of            usage  or  the  identity  of  the  receiving  payment  service  provider.    	1
3.1. Competent authorities should respond to the Commission and to the EBA using the template in      the Annex. Competent authorities should	send  the  responses  to  the  following  dedicated            mailboxes        	1
4.1. Competent authorities should base their decisions on relevant data. Competent authorities      may make use of data from a wide range	of  sources,  provided  the  data  is  reliable.      	1
4.2. Competent authorities should ensure that they are able to provide supporting data to justify      any decision to include or exclude	particular  services  from  their  list.          	1
5.1. Competent authorities shall submit the provisional list in accordance with Article 3(3) of      	Directive 2014/92/EU by 18 September 2015. 	1
11.When applying Article 4(1)(39)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions are required to    assume that two or more clients constitute a single risk	when  there  is  a  control  relationship        between  them.            	1
12.In exceptional cases, where institutions are able to demonstrate that no single risk exists despite    the existence of a control relationship among clients,	institutions  should  document  the  relevant        circumstances  that  justify  this  case  in  a  detailed  and  comprehensible  manner.  For  example,  in        specific  cases  where  a  special  purpose  entity  that  is  controlled  by  another  client  (e.g.  an        originator)  is  fully  ring-fenced  and  bankruptcy  remote  –  so  that  there  is  no  possible  channel  of        contagion,  and  hence  no  single  risk,  between  the  special  purpose  entity  and  the  controlling  entity        –  it  may  be  possible  to  demonstrate  that  no  single  risk  exists  (see  scenario  C  1  in  the  annex).    	1
13.Institutions should apply the concept of control as defined in Article 4(1)(37) of Regulation (EU)    	No 575/2013 as follows:    	1
14.Given that the decisive factor for the assessment of the existence of a control relationship is the    accounting criteria or indicators of control	set  out  in  paragraph  13(a),  (b)  and  (c),  institutions        should  group  two  or  more  clients  on  account  of  a  relationship  of  control,  as  described  in  this        section,  even  where  these  clients  are  not  included  in  the  same  consolidated  financial  statements        because  exemptions  apply  to  them  under  the  relevant  accounting  rules,  for  example  under        Article  23  of  Directive  2013/34/EU.      	1
15.Institutions should group two or more clients into a group of connected clients on account of a    relationship of control among these clients	regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  exposures  to  these        clients  are  exempted  from  the  application  of  the  large  exposures  limit  under  Article  400(1)  and  -2        of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  or  in  accordance  with  exemptions  under  national  rules        implementing  Article  493(3)  of  that  Regulation.            	1
16.In line with the definition of ‘group of connected clients’ under the last subparagraph of    Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions	may  assess  the  existence  of  a  group        of  connected  clients  separately  for  each  of  the  persons  directly  controlled  by  or  directly        interconnected  with  the  central  government  (‘alternative  approach’).  14      	1
17.The same provision allows for a partial application of the alternative approach, assessing    separately the natural or legal persons directly controlled by or	directly  interconnected  with  the        central  government  (see  scenario  CG  1  in  the  annex).  	1
19.Where the entities directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government    are economically dependent on each other, they should form separate	groups  of  connected        clients  (excluding  the  central  government),  in  addition  to  the  groups  of  connected  clients  formed        in  accordance  with  the  alternative  approach  (see  scenario  CG  4  in  the  annex).    	1
20. In line with the last sentence of the last subparagraph of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU)    No 575/2013, this section of the	guidelines  is  also  applicable  to  regional  governments  or  local        authorities  to  which  Article  115(2)  of  that  Regulation  applies,  and  natural  or  legal  persons  directly        controlled  by  or  interconnected  with  these  regional  governments  or  local  authorities.        	1
14   In accordance with Article 400(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, asset items constituting claims on central governments, which unsecured would be assigned a	0,00 %  risk  weight  under  the  standardised  approach,  are  exempted  from  the  application  of  Article  395(1)  (limits  to  large  exposures)  of  the  same  regulation.  	1
21.When assessing interconnectedness among their clients based on economic dependency, in    accordance with Article 4(1)(39)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take	into        account  the  specific  circumstances  of  each  case,  in  particular  whether  the  financial  difficulties  or        the  failure  of  a  client  would  lead  to  funding  or  repayment  difficulties  for  another  client  (see        scenarios  E  1  E  2  E  3  and  E  4  in  the  annex).            	1
22.Where an institution is able to demonstrate that the financial difficulties or the failure of a client    would not lead to funding or	repayment  difficulties  for  another  client,  these  clients  do  not  need  to        be  considered  a  single  risk.  In  addition,  two  clients  do  not  need  to  be  considered  a  single  risk  if  a        client  is  economically  dependent  on  another  client  in  a  limited  way,  meaning  that  the  client  can        easily  find  a  replacement  for  the  other  client.    	1
23.Institutions should consider, in particular, the following situations whe	n assessing economic    dependency:     	1
24.Institutions should also consider the non-exhaustive list of situations in paragraph 23 when    assessing connections among shadow banking entities. 16 Institutions should give	due        consideration  to  the  fact  that  relationships  between  entities  falling  under  the  definition  of        shadow  banking  entities  will  most  likely  consist  not  of  equity  ties  but  rather  of  a  different  type  of        relationship,  i.e.  situations  of  de  facto  control  or  relationships  characterised  by  contractual        obligations,  implicit  support  or  potential  reputational  risk  (e.g.  sponsorship  or  even  branding).          	1
25.Where an institution’s client is economically dependent on more than one client, which are not    dependent on each other, the institution should include	the  latter  clients  in  separate  groups  of        connected  clients  (together  with  the  dependent  client).              	1
26.Institutions should form a group of connected clients where two or more of their clients are    economically dependent on an entity, even if	this  entity  is  not  a  client  of  the  institution.  	1
27.Institutions should group two or more clients into a group of connected clients on account of    economic dependency among these clients regardless of	whether  or  not  the  exposures  to  these        clients  are  exempted  from  the  application  of  the  large  exposures  limit  under  Article  400(1)  and  -2        of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  or  in  accordance  with  exemptions  under  national  rules        implementing  Article  493(3)  of  that  Regulation.  	1
28.Institutions should consider situations where the funding problems of one client are likely to    spread to another on account of a one-way or	two-way  dependency  on  the  same  funding  source.        This  does  not  include  cases  where  clients  get  funding  from  the  same  market  (e.g.  the  market  for        commercial  paper)  or  where  clients’  dependency  on  their  existing  source  of  funding  is  caused  by              	1
16   As defined in the EBA guidelines on limits on exposures to shadow banking entities that carry out banking activities outside a regulated framework	under  Article  395(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013:  https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/large-exposures/guidelines-on-limits-on-exposures-to-shadow-banking  	1
29.Institutions should consider cases where the common source of funding depended on is provided    by the institution itself, its financial group or its	connected  parties  (see  scenarios  E  5  and  E  6  in  the        annex)  17.  Being  clients  of  the  same  institution  does  not  in  itself  create  a  requirement  to  group  the        clients  if  the  institution  providing  funding  can  be  easily  replaced.              	1
30.Institutions should also assess any contagion or idiosyncratic risk that could   	 emerge from the    following situations:    	1
31.Institutions should first identify which clients are connected via control in accordance with    Article 4(1)(39)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (‘control group’) and	which  clients  are        connected  via  economic  dependency  in  accordance  with  Article  4(1)(39)(b)  of  the  same        Regulation.  Subsequently,  institutions  should  assess  whether  the  identified  groups  of  connected        clients  need  to  be  (partially)  connected  themselves  (e.g.  whether  groups  of  clients  connected  on        account  of  economic  dependency  need  to  be  grouped  together  with  a  control  group).  	1
32.In their assessment, institutions should consider each case separately, i.e. identify the possible    chain of contagion (‘domino effect’) based on the individual circumstances	(see  scenarios  C/E  1        and  C/E  2  in  the  annex).        	1
33.Where clients that are part of different control groups are interconnected via economic    dependency, all entities for which a chain of contagion exists	need  to  be  grouped  into  one  group        of  connected  clients.  Downstream  contagion  should  always  be  assumed  when  a  client  is        economically  dependent  and  is  itself  the  head  of  a  control  group  (see  scenario  C/E  3  in  the  annex).        Upstream  contagion  of  clients  that  control  an  economically  dependent  entity  should  be  assumed        only  when  this  controlling  client  is  also  economically  dependent  on  the  entity  that  constitutes  the        economic  link  between  the  two  controlling  groups  (see  scenario  C/E  4  in  the  annex).            	1
34.Institutions should have a thorough knowledge of their clients and their clients’ relationships.    Institutions should also ensure that their staff understand and apply	these  guidelines.  	1
35.Identification of possible connections among clients should be an integral part of an institution’s    credit granting and surveillance process. The management body and	senior  management  should        ensure  that  adequate  processes  for  the  identification  of  connections  among  clients  are        documented  and  implemented.              	1
36.Institutions should identify all control relationships among their clients and document as    appropriate. Institutions should also investigate, and document as appropriate, any potential	      economic  dependencies  among  their  clients.  Institutions  should  take  reasonable  steps  and  use        readily  available  information  to  identify  these  connections.  If,  for  example,  an  institution  becomes        aware  that  clients  have  been  considered  interconnected  by  another  institution  (e.g.  because  of        the  existence  of  a  public  register),  it  should  take  into  account  that  information.      	1
37.The efforts that institutions put into the investigation of economic dependencies among their    clients should be proportionate to the size of the exposures.	Therefore,  institutions  should        strengthen  their  investigations,  by  extensive  research  of  any  type  of  ‘soft  information’  as  well  as        information  that  goes  beyond  the  institutions’  clients,  in  all  cases  where  the  sum  of  all  exposures        to  one  individual  client  exceeds  5,00 %  of  Tier  1  capital.  18          	1
38.To assess grouping requirements based on a combination of control and economic dependency    relationships, institutions should collect information on all entities forming a	chain  of  contagion.        Institutions  might  not  be  able  to  identify  all  clients  that  constitute  a  single  risk  if  there  are        interconnections  that  stem  from  entities  that  are  not  in  a  business  relationship  with  the        institution  and  are  therefore  unknown  to  the  institution  (see  scenario  Mm  1  in  the  annex).        However,  if  an  institution  becomes  aware  of  interconnections  via  entities  outside  its  clientele,  it        should  use  this  information  when  assessing  connections.    	1
39.Control and management procedures for identifying connected clients should be subject to    periodic review to ensure their appropriateness. Institutions should also monitor changes	to        interconnections,  at  least  in  the  context  of  their  periodic  loan  reviews  and  when  a  substantial        increase  to  a  loan  is  planned.      	1
18   The threshold refers to the institution’s Tier 1 capital for the purposes of applying these guidelines on an individual basis. The threshold refers	to  the  Tier  1  capital  of  the  group  of  the  institution  for  the  purposes  of  applying  these  guidelines  on  a  subconsolidated  or  consolidated  basis.              	1
1. Institutions should consider that investments in venture capital firms referred to in point (a) of    Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013	include,  at  a  minimum,  any  investment  that        meets  both  of  the  following  conditions:  	1
2. Institutions should consider that investments in private equity referred to in point (c) of    Article 128(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 include,	at  a  minimum,  any  investment  that        meets  both  of  the  following  conditions:    	1
3. The scope of the exercise of identifying items associated with particularly high risk that are not    already covered by Article 128(2) of	Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  should  cover  all  exposure        classes,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  the  exposure  classes  referred  to  in  points  (g),  (p)  and  (q)        of  Article  112  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.            	1
4. Institutions should consider as items associated with particularly high risk, from among those    referred to in paragraph 3 at a minimum, those	exposures  that  exhibit  levels  and  ranges  of  risk        drivers  that  are  not  common  to  other  obligors  or  transactions  of  the  same  exposure  class.          	1
5. For the purposes of paragraph 4 institutions should consider, at a minimum, all of the following    exposures as exhibiting levels and ranges	of  risk  drivers  that  are  not  common  to  other  obligors        or  transactions  of  the  same  exposure  class:        	1
6. All equity exposures to a given issuer should be considered whether to be classified as items    associated with particularly high risk where	either  of  the  following  conditions  is  met:      	1
7. Where institutions identify any types of exposures carrying a particularly high risk of loss in    accordance with the conditions set out in	Article  128(3)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  other        than  those  identified  in  accordance  with  paragraph  5  or  6  institutions  should  notify  the        competent  authorities  in  their  jurisdiction,  together  with  a  brief  description  of  the  main        characteristics  of  these  exposures.  The  competent  authorities  should,  in  turn,  notify  the  EBA.    	1
11. In order to apply these guidelines for the first time, institutions that use the IRB Approach     should assess and accordingly adjust,	where  necessary,  their  rating  systems  so  that  the          estimates  of  risk  parameters  reflect  the  new  definition  of  default  according  to  these          guidelines  by  applying  the  following:        	1
12. The changes referred to in paragraph 11 which are applied to the rating systems as a result of     the application of	these  guidelines,  are  required  to  be  verified  by  the  internal  validation          function  and  classified  according  to  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  529/2014,  and,          depending  on  this  classification,  they  are  required  to  be  notified  or  approved  by  the  relevant          competent  authority.              	1
13. Institutions that use the IRB Approach, and which need to obtain prior permission from     competent authorities in accordance with Article 143	of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and          Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  529/2014  2  in  order  to  incorporate  these          guidelines  by  the  deadline  referred  to  in  paragraph  10  should  agree  with  their  competent          	1
14. After IRB institutions have started collecting data according to the new definition of default as     provided in these guidelines, in the	course  of  their  regular  revision  of  risk  estimates  referred          to  in  Article  179(1)(c)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  those  institutions  should  extend  or,          where  justified,  move  the  window  of  historical  data  used  for  the  risk  quantification  to  include          new  data.  Until  an  adequate  time  period  with  homogenous  default  definition  is  reached,          those  IRB  institutions,  during  their  regular  revisions  of  the  risk  parameter  estimates,  should          assess  the  adequacy  of  the  level  of  the  margin  of  conservatism  referred  to  in  point  (b)  of          paragraph  11.  	1
15. Sections 3.3.2.1. and 3.4.4. of the CEBS Guidelines on the implementation, validation and     assessment of Advanced Measurement (AMA) and Internal Ratings	Based  (IRB)  Approaches          (GL10)  published  on  4  April  2006  are  repealed  with  effect  from  1  January  2021.      	1
16. For the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013, where any amount of	principal,  interest  or  fee  has  not  been  paid  at  the  date  it  was          due,  institutions  should  recognise  this  as  the  credit  obligation  past  due.  Where  there  are          modifications  of  the  schedule  of  credit  obligations,  as  referred  to  in  point  (e)  of  Article  178(2)          of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  the  institution’s  policies  should  clarify  that  the  counting  of          days  past  due  should  be  based  on  the  modified  schedule  of  payments.    	1
17. Where the credit arrangement explicitly allows the obligor to change the schedule, suspend     or postpone the payments under certain conditions and	the  obligor  acts  within  the  rights          granted  in  the  contract,  the  changed,  suspended  or  postponed  instalments  should  not  be          considered  past  due,  but  the  counting  of  days  past  due  should  be  based  on  the  new  schedule          once  it  is  specified.  Nevertheless  if  the  obligor  changes  the  schedule,  suspends  or  postpones          the  payments,  the  institutions  should  analyse  the  reasons  for  such  a  change  and  assess  the          possible  indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay,  in  accordance  with  Articles  178(1)  and  -3  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and  Section  5  of  these  guidelines.    	1
18. Where the repayment of the obligation is suspended because of a law allowing this option or     other legal restrictions, the counting	of  days  past  due  should  also  be  suspended  during  that              	1
19. Where the repayment of the obligation is the subject of a dispute between the obligor and     the institution, the counting of	days  past  due  may  be  suspended  until  the  dispute  is  resolved,          where  at  least  one  of  the  following  conditions  is  met:            	1
20. Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or     any other similar	transaction,  the  counting  of  days  past  due  should  start  from  the  moment  a          different  person  or  entity  becomes  obliged  to  pay  the  obligation.  The  counting  of  days  past          due  is,  instead,  unaffected  by  a  change  in  the  obligor’s  name.          	1
21. The calculation of the sum of all amounts past due that are related to any credit obligation of     the obligor to	the  institution,  parent  undertaking  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  to  this  obligor  and          which  institutions  are  required  to  calculate  for  the  purpose  of  comparison  with  the          materiality  threshold  set  by  the  competent  authority  in  accordance  with  point  (d)  of  Article          178(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  should  be  performed  with  a  frequency  allowing  timely          identification  of  default.  Institutions  should  ensure  that  the  information  about  the  days  past          due  and  default  is  up-to-date  whenever  it’s  being  used  for  decision  making,  internal  risk          management,  internal  or  external  reporting  and  the  own  funds  requirements  calculation          processes.  Where  institutions  calculate  days  past  due  less  often  than  daily,  they  should          ensure  that  the  date  of  default  is  identified  as  the  date  when  the  past  due  criterion  has          actually  been  fulfilled.      	1
22. The classification of the obligor to a defaulted status should not be subject to additional     expert judgement; once the obligor meets	the  past  due  criterion  all  exposures  to  that  obligor          are  considered  defaulted,  unless  either  of  the  following  conditions  is  met:              	1
23. A technical past due situation should only be considered to have occurred 	in any of the     following cases:   	1
24. Technical past due situations should not be considered as 	defaults in accordance with Article     	1
25. Institutions may apply specific treatment for exposures to central governments, local     authorities and public sector entities where all of the following	conditions  are  met:              	1
26. Institutions that decide to apply the specific treatment referred to in paragrap	h 25 should     apply all of the following:  	1
27. Where there are factoring arrangements whereby the ceded receivables are not recognised     on the balance sheet of the factor and the	factor  is  liable  directly  to  the  client  up  to  a  certain          agreed  percentage,  the  counting  of  days  past  due  should  commence  from  when  the  factoring          account  is  in  debit,  i.e.  from  when  the  advances  paid  for  the  receivables  exceed  the          percentage  agreed  between  the  factor  and  the  client.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  items  of          the  client  of  a  factor  that  are  past  due,  institutions  should  apply  both  of  the  following:              	1
28. Where there are factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are recognised on     the balance sheet of the factor and the factor	has  exposures  to  the  debtors  of  the  client,  the          counting  of  days  past  due  should  commence  when  the  payment  for  a  single  receivable        	1
29. Where the institution recognises events related to dilution risk of purchased receivables as     defined in point -53 of Article 4(1) of	Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  these  events  should  not          be  considered  as  leading  to  the  default  of  the  obligor.  Where  the  amount  of  receivable  has          been  reduced  as  a  result  of  events  related  to  dilution  risk  such  as  discounts,  deductions,          netting  or  credit  notes  issued  by  the  seller  the  reduced  amount  of  receivable  should  be          included  in  the  calculation  of  days  past  due.  Where  there  is  a  dispute  between  the  obligor  and          the  seller  and  such  event  is  recognised  as  related  to  dilution  risk  the  counting  of  days  past  due          should  be  suspended  until  the  dispute  is  resolved.  	1
30. Events recognised as related to dilution risk and hence excluded from the identification of     default should be included in the calculation	of  own  funds  requirements  or  internal  capital  for          dilution  risk.  Where  institutions  recognise  significant  number  of  events  related  to  dilution  risk,          they  should  analyse  and  document  the  reasons  for  such  events  and  assess  the  possible          indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay,  in  accordance  with  Articles  178(1)  and  -3  of  Regulation  (EU)          No  575/2013  and  Section  5  of  these  guidelines.            	1
31. Where the obligor has not been adequately informed about the cession of the receivable by     the factor’s client and the institution	has  evidence  that  the  payment  for  the  receivable  has          been  made  to  the  client,  the  institution  should  not  consider  the  receivable  to  be  past  due.          Where  the  obligor  has  been  adequately  informed  about  the  cession  of  the  receivable  but  has          nevertheless  made  the  payment  to  the  client,  the  institution  should  continue  counting  the          days  past  due  according  to  the  conditions  of  the  receivable.  	1
32. In the specific case of undisclosed factoring arrangements, where the obligors are not     informed about the cession of the receivables but	the  purchased  receivables  are  recognised          on  the  balance  sheet  of  the  factor,  the  counting  of  days  past  due  should  commence  from  the          moment  agreed  with  the  client  when  the  payments  made  by  the  obligors  should  be          transferred  from  the  client  to  the  factor.        	1
33. Competent authorities should notify the EBA of the levels of the materiality thresholds that     they set in their respective jurisdiction in	accordance  with  point  (d)  of  Article  178(2)  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  After  the  entry  into  force  of  the  regulatory  technical  standards          developed  in  accordance  with  Article  178(6)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  where          competent  authorities  set  the  relative  component  of  the  materiality  threshold  at  a  level          different  than  the  1,00 %  referred  to  in  those  regulatory  technical  standards,  they  should  provide          the  justification  for  this  different  level  of  the  threshold  to  the  EBA.  	1
34. Institutions should apply the materiality threshold for past due credit obligations set by their     competent authorities as referred to in point	(d)  of  Article  178(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No          575/2013.  Institutions  may  identify  defaults  on  the  basis  of  a  lower  threshold  if  they  can          demonstrate  that  this  lower  threshold  is  a  relevant  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  and  does          not  lead  to  an  excessive  number  of  defaults  that  return  to  non-defaulted  status  shortly  after          being  recognised  as  defaulted  or  decrease  of  capital  requirements.  In  this  case  institutions          should  record  in  their  databases  the  information  on  the  trigger  of  default  as  an  additional          specified  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay.        	1
35. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (a) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,	institutions  should  consider  that  an  obligor  is  unlikely  to  pay          where  interest  related  to  credit  obligations  is  no  longer  recognised  in  the  income  statement          of  the  institution  due  to  the  decrease  of  the  credit  quality  of  the  obligation.            	1
36. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (b) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,	all  of  the  following  specific  credit  risk  adjustments  (SCRA)          should  be  considered  to  be  a  result  of  a  significant  perceived  decline  in  the  credit  quality  of  a          credit  obligation  and  hence  should  be  treated  as  an  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay:      	1
37. The SCRA that cover the losses for which historical experience, adjusted on the basis of     current observable data, indicate that the	loss  has  occurred  but  the  institution  is  not  yet          aware  which  individual  exposure  has  suffered  these  losses  (‘incurred  but  not  reported          losses’),  should  not  be  considered  an  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  of  a  specific  obligor.  	1
38. Where the institution treats an exposure as impaired such a situation should be considered an     additional indication of unlikeliness to pay	and  hence  the  obligor  should  be  considered          defaulted  regardless  of  whether  there  are  any  SCRA  assigned  to  this  exposure.  Where  in          accordance  with  the  applicable  accounting  framework  in  the  case  of  incurred  but  not      	1
39. Where the institution treats an exposure as credit-impaired under IFRS 9 i.e. assigns it to     Stage 3 as defined in IFRS	9  Financial  Instruments,  published  by  the  IASB  in  July  2014  such          exposure  should  be  considered  defaulted,  except  where  the  exposure  has  been  considered          credit-impaired  due  to  the  delay  in  payment  and  either  or  both  of  the  following  conditions          are  met:              	1
40. Where the institution uses both IFRS 9 and another accounting framework it should choose     whether to classify exposures as defaulted in	accordance  with  paragraphs  36  to  38  or  in          accordance  with  paragraph  39.  Once  this  choice  is  made  it  should  be  applied  consistently  over          time.            	1
41. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (c) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,	institutions  should  take  into  account  both  the  character  and          materiality  of  the  loss  related  to  the  sale  of  credit  obligations,  in  accordance  with  the          following  paragraphs.  Transactions  of  traditional  securitisation  with  significant  risk  transfer          and  any  intragroup  sales  of  credit  obligations  should  be  considered  sale  of  credit  obligations.            	1
42. Institutions should analyse the reasons for the sale of credit obligations and the reasons for     any losses recognised thereby. Where the	reasons  for  the  sale  of  credit  obligations  were  not          related  to  credit  risk,  such  as  where  there  is  the  need  to  increase  the  liquidity  of  the          institution  or  there  is  a  change  in  business  strategy,  and  the  institution  does  not  perceive  the          credit  quality  of  those  obligations  as  declined,  the  economic  loss  related  with  the  sale  of          those  obligations  should  be  considered  not  credit-related.  In  that  case  the  sale  should  not  be          considered  an  indication  of  default  even  where  the  loss  is  material,  on  condition  of  the          appropriate,  documented  justification  of  the  treatment  of  the  sale  loss  as  not  credit-related.          Institutions  may,  in  particular,  consider  the  loss  on  the  sale  of  credit  obligations  as  non-credit          related  where  the  assets  subject  to  the  sale  are  publicly  traded  assets  and  measured  at  fair          value.      	1
43. Where, however, the loss on the sale of credit obligations is related to the credit quality of     the obligations themselves, in	particular  where  the  institution  sells  the  credit  obligations  due          to  the  decrease  in  their  quality,  the  institution  should  analyse  the  materiality  of  the  economic          loss  and,  where  the  economic  loss  is  material,  this  should  be  considered  an  indication  of          default.              	1
44. Institutions should set a threshold for the credit-related economic loss related with the sale of     credit obligations to be considered material,	which  should  be  calculated  according  to  the          following  formula,  and  should  not  be  higher  than  5%:        	1
45. In order to assess the materiality of the overall economic loss related with the sale of credit     obligations, institutions should calculate	the  economic  loss  and  compare  it  to  the  threshold          referred  to  in  paragraph  44.  Where  the  economic  loss  is  higher  than  this  threshold  they          should  consider  the  credit  obligations  defaulted.              	1
46. The sale of credit obligations may be performed either before or after the default. In the case     of institutions that use	the  IRB  Approach,  regardless  of  the  moment  of  the  sale,  if  the  sale  was          related  with  a  material  credit-related  economic  loss,  the  information  about  the  loss  should  be          adequately  recorded  and  stored  for  the  purpose  of  the  estimation  of  risk  parameters.      	1
47. If the sale of a credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss occurred before the     identification of default on that	exposure,  the  moment  of  sale  should  be  considered  the          moment  of  default.  In  the  case  of  a  partial  sale  of  the  total  obligations  of  an  obligor  where  the          sale  is  associated  to  a  material  credit-related  economic  loss,  all  the  remaining  exposures  to          this  obligor  should  be  treated  as  defaulted,  unless  the  exposures  are  eligible  as  retail          exposures  and  the  institution  applies  the  default  definition  at  facility  level.        	1
48. In the case of a sale of a portfolio of exposures the treatment of individual credit obligations     within this portfolio should	be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  manner  the  price  for  the          portfolio  was  set.  Where  the  price  for  the  total  portfolio  was  determined  by  specifying  the          discount  on  particular  credit  obligations,  the  materiality  of  credit-related  economic  loss          should  be  assessed  individually  for  each  exposure  within  the  portfolio.  Where  however  the          price  was  set  only  at  the  portfolio  level,  the  materiality  of  credit-related  economic  loss  may  be          assessed  at  the  portfolio  level  and  in  that  case,  if  the  threshold  specified  in  paragraph  44  is          	1
49. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,	a  distressed  restructuring  should  be  considered  to  have          occurred  when  concessions  have  been  extended  towards  a  debtor  facing  or  about  to  face          difficulties  in  meeting  its  financial  commitments  as  specified  in  paragraphs  163-167  and  -172    	1
50. Given that, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the     obligor should be considered	defaulted  where  the  distressed  restructuring  is  likely  to  result  in          a  diminished  financial  obligation,  where  considering  forborne  exposures,  the  obligor  should          be  classified  as  defaulted  only  where  the  relevant  forbearance  measures  are  likely  to  result  in          a  diminished  financial  obligation.              	1
51. Institutions should set a threshold for the diminished financial obligation that is considered to     be caused by material forgiveness or postponement	of  principal,  interest,  or  fees,  and  which          should  be  calculated  according  to  the  following  formula,  and  should  not  be  higher  than  1%:          	1
52. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU) No 575/2013,	for  each  distressed  restructuring,  institutions  should  calculate          the  diminished  financial  obligation  and  compare  it  with  the  threshold  referred  to  in  paragraph            	1
51. Where the diminished financial obligation is higher than this threshold, the 	exposures     should be considered defaulted.     	1
53. If however the diminished financial obligation is below the specified threshold, and in     particular when the net present value of expected	cash  flows  based  on  the  distressed          restructuring  arrangement  is  higher  than  the  net  present  value  of  expected  cash  flows  before          the  changes  in  terms  and  conditions,  institutions  should  assess  such  exposures  for  other          possible  indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay.  Where  the  institution  has  reasonable  doubts  with          regard  to  the  likeliness  of  repayment  in  full  of  the  obligation  according  to  the  new          arrangement  in  a  timely  manner,  the  obligor  should  be  considered  defaulted.  The  indicators          that  may  suggest  unlikeliness  to  pay  include  the  following:  	1
54. Any concession extended to an obligor already in default, should lead to classify the obligor as     a distressed restructuring. All exposures	classified  as  forborne  non-performing  in  accordance          with  Annex  V  of  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014  of  16  April  2014  as          amended  by  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2015/227  should  be  classified  as          default  and  subject  to  distressed  restructuring.    	1
55. Where any of the modifications of the schedule of credit obligations referred to in point (e) of     Article 178(2) of Regulation	(EU)  No  575/2013  is  the  result  of  financial  difficulties  of  an          obligor,  institutions  should  also  assess  whether  a  distressed  restructuring  has  taken  place  and          whether  an  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  has  occurred.        	1
56. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of     Regulation (EU)	No  575/2013,  institutions  should  clearly  specify  in  their  internal  policies  what          type  of  arrangement  is  treated  as  an  order  or  as  a  protection  similar  to  bankruptcy,  taking          into  account  all  relevant  legal  frameworks  as  well  as  the  following  typical  characteristics  of          such  protection:        	1
57. Institutions should treat all arrangements listed in Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 5 as     an order or as a protection	similar  to  bankruptcy.              	1
58. Institutions should specify in their internal policies and procedures other additional     indications of unlikeliness to pay of an obligor, besides those	specified  in  Article  178(3)  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  Those  additional  indications  should  be  specified  per  type  of          exposures,  as  defined  in  point  -2  of  Article  142(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  reflecting          their  specificities,  and  they  should  be  specified  for  all  business  lines,  legal  entities  or          geographical  locations.  The  occurrence  of  an  additional  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay          should  either  result  in  an  automatic  reclassification  to  defaulted  exposures  or  trigger  a  caseby  	1
59. The possible indications of unlikeliness to pay that could be considered by institutions on the     basis of internal information include the	following:    	1
60. Institutions should also take into account the information available in external databases,     including credit registers, macroeconomic indicators and public information sources,	including          press  articles  and  financial  analyst’s  reports.  The  indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  that  could          be  considered  by  institutions  on  the  basis  of  external  information  include  the  following:    	1
61. When specifying the criteria for unlikeliness to pay, institutions should take into consideration     the relations within the groups of connected clients	as  defined  in  point  39  of  Article  4(1)  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  In  particular  institutions  should  specify  in  their  internal  policies          when  the  default  of  one  obligor  within  the  group  of  connected  clients  has  a  contagious  effect          on  other  entities  within  this  group.  Such  specifications  should  be  in  line  with  the  appropriate          policies  for  the  assignment  of  exposures  to  individual  obligor  to  an  obligor  grade  and  to          groups  of  connected  clients  in  accordance  with  point  (d)  of  Article  172(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)          No  575/2013.  Where  such  criteria  have  not  been  specified  for  a  non-standard  situation,  in  the          case  of  default  of  an  obligor  that  is  part  of  a  group  of  connected  clients,  institutions  should          assess  the  potential  unlikeliness  to  pay  of  all  other  entities  within  this  group  on  a  case-by-case          basis.      	1
62. Where a financial asset was purchased or originated by an institution at a material discount     institutions should assess whether that discount	reflects  the  deteriorated  credit  quality  of  the          obligor  and  whether  there  are  any  indications  of  default  in  accordance  with  these  guidelines.          The  assessment  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  should  refer  to  the  total  amount  owed  by  the  obligor          regardless  of  the  price  that  the  institution  has  paid  for  the  asset.  This  assessment  may  be          based  on  the  due  diligence  performed  before  the  purchase  of  the  asset  or  on  the  analysis    	1
63. Institutions should have adequate policies and procedures to identify credit frauds. Typically     when credit fraud is identified, the exposure is already	defaulted  on  the  basis  of  material          delays  in  payment.  However,  if  the  credit  fraud  is  identified  before  default  has  been          recognised  this  should  be  treated  as  an  additional  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay.        	1
64. Institutions should establish policies regarding the definition of default in order to ensure its     consistent and effective application and in particular	they  should  have  clear  policies  and          procedures  on  the  application  of  the  criteria  for  unlikeliness  to  pay  as  laid  down  in  Article          178(3)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and  all  other  indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  as          specified  by  the  institution,  covering  all  types  of  exposures  as  defined  in  point  -2  of  Article          142(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  for  all  business  lines,  legal  entities  and  geographical          locations.            	1
65. With regard to each indication of unlikeliness to pay institutions should define the adequate     methods of their identification, including the sources	of  information  and  frequency  of          monitoring.  The  sources  of  information  should  include  both  internal  and  external  sources,          including  in  particular  relevant  external  databases  and  registers.          	1
66. Institutions that use the IRB Approach and use external data for the purpose of estimation of     risk parameters in accordance with	Article  178(4)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  should          apply  the  requirements  specified  in  this  section.          	1
67. For the purposes of Article 178(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should 	do all of     the following:   	1
68. For each difference identified in the definition of default resulting from the assessment of     paragraph 67 institutions should do all of	the  following:  	1
69. Regarding the totality of the differences identified in the definition of default resulting from     the assessment of paragraph 67 and taking	into  account  the  adjustments  performed  in          accordance  with  point  (b)  of  paragraph  68  institutions  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  to          competent  authorities  that  broad  equivalence  with  the  internal  definition  of  default  has  been          achieved,  including,  where  possible  by  comparing  the  default  rate  in  internal  data  on  a          relevant  type  of  exposures  with  external  data.      	1
70. Where the assessment of paragraph 67 identifies differences in the definition of default     which the process of paragraph 68 reveals to	be  non-negligible  but  not  possible  to  overcome          by  adjustments  in  the  external  data,  institutions  are  required  to  adopt  an  appropriate  margin          of  conservatism  in  the  estimation  of  risk  parameters  as  referred  to  in  Article  179(1)(f)  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  In  that  case  institutions  should  ensure  that  this  additional          margin  of  conservatism  reflects  the  materiality  of  the  remaining  differences  in  the  definition          of  default  and  their  possible  impact  on  all  risk  parameters.    	1
71. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, except for     situations referred to in paragraph 72	institutions  should  apply  all  of  the  following:      	1
72. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where     distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49	of  these  guidelines  applies  to  a  defaulted          exposure,  regardless  of  whether  such  restructuring  was  carried  out  before  or  after  the          identification  of  default,  institutions  should  consider  that  no  trigger  of  default  continues  to          apply  to  a  previously  defaulted  exposure,  where  at  least  1  year  has  passed  from  the  latest          between  one  of  the  following  events:    	1
73. Institutions should reclassify the exposure to a non-defaulted status after at least the one     year period referred to in the previous	paragraph,  where  all  of  the  following  conditions  are          met:        	1
74. Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or     any other similar	transaction,  the  institution  should  not  apply  paragraph  73(a).  Where  the          obligor’s  name  changes,  instead,  institutions  should  apply  that  paragraph.  	1
75. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, an     institution should define clear criteria and policies	regarding  when  the  obligor  can  be          classified  back  to  non-defaulted  status  and  more  in  particular,  both  of  the  following:  	1
76. Institutions should monitor on a regular basis the effectiveness of their policies mentioned in     paragraph 75 and in particular monitor and	analyse:    	1
77. It is expected that the institution would have a limited number of obligors who default soon     after returning to a non-defaulted	status.  In  the  case  of  extensive  number  of  multiple  defaults          the  institution  should  revise  its  policies  with  regard  to  the  reclassification  of  exposures.        	1
78. The analysis of the changes in statuses of the obligors or facilities should in particular be     taken into account for the	purpose  of  specifying  the  periods  referred  to  in  paragraphs  71  and            	1
72. Institutions may specify longer periods for the exposures that have been classified as     	defaulted in the preceding 24 months.  	1
79. Institutions should adopt adequate mechanisms and procedures in order to ensure that the     definition of default is implemented and used in	a  correct  manner,  and  should,  in  particular,          ensure:          	1
81. Where the exchange of client data among different legal entities within an institution, the     parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries	is  prohibited  by  consumer  protection  regulations,        	1
82. Further, where the identification of default of an obligor in a manner fully consistent across     the institution, the parent undertaking or	any  of  its  subsidiaries  is  very  burdensome,  requiring          development  of  a  centralised  database  of  all  clients  or  implementation  of  other  mechanisms          or  procedures  to  verify  the  status  of  each  client  at  all  entities  within  the  group,  institutions          need  not  apply  such  mechanisms  or  procedures  if  they  can  demonstrate  that  the  effect  of          non-compliance  is  immaterial  because  there  are  no  or  very  limited  number  of  common  clients          among  the  relevant  entities  within  a  group  and  the  exposure  to  these  clients  is  immaterial.              	1
83. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 79 an institution, parent undertaking or any of its     subsidiaries should use the	same  definition  of  default  for  a  single  type  of  exposures  as  defined          in  point  -2  of  Article  142(1)  pf  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  They  may  use  different          definitions  of  default  for  different  types  of  exposures,  including  for  certain  legal  entities  or  for          presence  in  geographical  locations  in  ways  other  than  via  a  legal  entity,  where  this  is  justified          by  the  application  of  significantly  different  internal  risk  management  practices  or  by  different          legal  requirements  applying  in  different  jurisdictions,  in  particular  by  reasons  such  as:          	1
84. For the purposes of point (b)(ii) of paragraph 79 and where different definitions of default     are applied either across types of	exposures  in  accordance  with  paragraph  83  the          institutions’  internal  procedures  relating  to  the  definition  of  default  should  ensure  both  of  the          following:  	1
85. Further, for institutions that use the IRB Approach, the use of different default definitions has     to be adequately reflected in the	estimation  of  risk  parameters  in  the  case  of  ratings  systems          which  scope  of  application  encompasses  different  default  definitions.    	1
86. According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in     the case of retail exposures, institutions may	apply  the  definition  of  default  at  the  level  of  an          individual  credit  facility  rather  than  in  relation  to  the  total  obligations  of  a  borrower.          Therefore,  institutions  that  use  the  IRB  Approach,  in  particular,  may  apply  the  definition  of          default  at  the  level  of  the  individual  facility  for  retail  exposures  as  defined  in  Article  147(5)  of          Regulation  (EU)  575/2013.  Institutions  that  use  the  Standardised  Approach,  instead  may  apply          the  definition  of  default  at  the  level  of  an  individual  credit  facility  for  all  exposures  that  meet          the  criteria  specified  in  Article  123  of  Regulation  (EU)  575/2013,  even  where  some  of  those          exposures  have  been  assigned  to  a  different  exposure  class  for  the  purpose  of  assigning  a  risk          weight,  such  as  exposures  secured  by  mortgages  on  immovable  property.              	1
87. Institutions should choose the level of application of the definition of default between obligor     and facility for all retail exposures in	a  way  that  reflects  their  internal  risk  management          practices.        	1
88. Institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an obligor for some types of     retail exposures and at	the  level  of  a  credit  facility  for  others,  where  this  is  well  justified  by          internal  risk  management  practices,  for  instance  due  to  a  different  business  model  of  a          subsidiary,  and  where  there  is  evidence  that  the  number  of  situations  where  the  same  clients          are  subject  to  different  definitions  of  default  at  different  levels  of  application  is  kept  to  a  strict          minimum.      	1
89. Where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for     different types of retail exposures, according	to  paragraph  88  they  should  ensure  that  the          scope  of  application  of  each  definition  of  default  is  clearly  specified  and  that  it  is  used          consistently  over  time  for  different  types  of  retail  exposures.  In  the  case  of  institutions  that          use  the  IRB  Approach  the  risk  estimates  should  correctly  reflect  the  definition  of  default          applied  to  each  type  of  exposures.          	1
90. Where institutions use different levels of application of the default definition with regard to     certain retail portfolios, the treatment of common	clients  across  such  portfolios  should  be          specified  in  their  internal  policies  and  procedures.  In  particular,  where  the  exposure  to  which              	1
91. The same rule should apply to the obligors treated under the Standardised Approach, where     some exposures to an obligor fulfil the	requirements  of  Article  123  of  Regulation  (EU)          575/2013  while  other  exposures  to  the  same  obligor  are  in  the  form  of  securities  and          therefore  do  not  qualify  as  retail.  Where  an  exposure  in  the  form  of  a  security  fulfils  either  or          both  of  the  conditions  of  points  (a)  or  (b)  of  Article  178(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  all          exposures  to  that  obligor  should  be  considered  defaulted.  Where  the  exposure  that  fulfils  the          requirements  of  Article  123  of  Regulation  (EU)  575/2013  meets  those  conditions  and  the          institution  applies  the  definition  of  default  at  the  individual  credit  facility  level,  the  other          exposures  to  the  obligor  should  not  be  automatically  reclassified  to  default  status.          Institutions,  however,  may  classify  those  other  exposures  as  defaulted  on  the  basis  of  other          unlikeliness  to  pay  considerations,  as  provided  further  in  paragraphs  92  to  94.          	1
92. Where, in accordance with the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013, the definition of default has been	applied  at  the  level  of  an  individual  credit  facility          with  regard  to  retail  exposures,  institutions  should  not  consider  automatically  the  different          exposures  to  the  same  obligor  defaulted  at  the  same  time.  Nevertheless  institutions  should          take  into  account  that  some  indications  of  default  are  related  with  the  condition  of  the          obligor  rather  than  the  status  of  a  particular  exposure.  This  refers  in  particular  to  the          indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  related  with  the  bankruptcy  of  the  obligor  as  specified  in          points  (e)  and  (f)  of  Article  178(3)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  Where  such  indication  of          default  occurs,  institutions  should  treat  all  exposures  to  the  same  obligor  as  defaulted          regardless  of  the  level  of  application  of  the  definition  of  default.            	1
93. Institutions should consider also other indications of unlikeliness to pay and specify, in line     with their internal policies and procedures, which	indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  reflect  the          overall  situation  of  an  obligor  rather  than  that  of  the  exposure.  Where  such  other  indications          of  unlikeliness  to  pay  occur,  all  exposures  to  the  obligor  should  be  considered  defaulted          regardless  of  the  level  of  application  of  the  definition  of  default.              	1
94. Additionally, where a significant part of the exposures to the obligor is in default, institutions     may consider it unlikely that the	other  obligations  of  that  obligor  will  be  paid  in  full  without          recourse  to  actions  such  as  realising  security  and  treat  them  as  defaulted  as  well.    	1
95. The application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the obligor level implies     that, where any credit obligation of	the  obligor  meets  the  conditions  of  points  (a)  or  (b)  or          both  of  Article  178(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  then  all  exposures  to  that  obligor          should  be  considered  defaulted.  Institutions  that  decide  to  apply  the  definition  of  default  for          retail  exposures  at  the  obligor  level  should  specify  detailed  rules  for  the  treatment  of  joint          credit  obligations  and  default  contagion  between  exposures  in  their  internal  policies  and          procedures.            	1
96. Institutions should consider a joint credit obligation as an exposure to two or more obligors     that are equally responsible for the	repayment  of  the  credit  obligation.  This  notion  does  not          extend  to  a  credit  obligation  of  an  individual  obligor  secured  by  another  individual  or  entity  in          the  form  of  a  guarantee  or  other  credit  protection.      	1
97. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013 are met with	regard  to  a  joint  credit  obligation  of  two  or  more  obligors,  institutions          should  consider  all  other  joint  credit  obligations  of  the  same  set  of  obligors  and  all  individual          exposures  to  those  obligors  as  defaulted,  unless  they  can  justify  that  the  recognition  of          default  on  individual  exposures  is  not  appropriate  because  at  least  one  of  the  following          conditions  apply:            	1
98. The default of a joint credit obligation should not cause the default of other joint credit     obligations of individual obligors with	other  individuals  or  entities,  which  are  not  involved  in          the  credit  obligation  that  has  initially  been  defaulted;  however,  institutions  should  assess          whether  the  default  of  the  joint  credit  obligation  at  hand  constitutes  an  indication  of          unlikeliness  to  pay  with  regard  to  the  other  joint  credit  obligations.  	1
99. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No     575/2013 are met with	regard  to  the  credit  obligation  of  an  individual  obligor,  the  contagious          effect  of  this  default  should  not  automatically  spread  to  any  joint  credit  obligations  of  that          obligor;  nevertheless,  institutions  should  assess  such  joint  credit  obligations  for  possible          indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  related  with  the  default  of  one  of  the  obligors.  In  any  case,              	1
100.    Institutions should identify, on the basis of the analysis of relevant legal provisions in a    jurisdiction, and provide in	their  internal  policies  and  procedures  for  the  identification  of  the        obligors  that  are  legally  fully  liable  for  certain  obligations  jointly  and  severally  with  other        obligors,  therefore  being  fully  liable  for  the  entire  amount  of  those  obligations,  but  excluding        credit  obligations  of  an  individual  obligor  secured  by  another  individual  or  entity  in  the  form        of  a  guarantee  or  other  credit  protection.  A  typical  example  would  be  a  married  couple        where,  based  on  specific  legal  provisions  applicable  in  the  relevant  jurisdiction,  division  of        marital  property  (system  of  separate  estates)  does  not  apply.  In  the  case  of  full  mutual        liability  for  all  obligations,  default  of  one  of  such  obligors  should  be  considered  an  indication        of  potential  unlikeliness  to  pay  of  the  other  obligor  and  therefore  institutions  should  assess        whether  the  individual  and  joint  credit  obligations  of  these  obligors  should  be  considered        defaulted.  Where  one  of  the  joint  and  several  obligors  that  are  legally  fully  liable  for  all  	1
101.   Institutions should also analyse the forms of legal entities in relevant jurisdictions and the    extent of liability of the owners,	partners,  shareholders  or  managers  for  the  obligations  of  a        company  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  entity.  Where  an  individual  is  fully  liable  for  the        obligations  of  a  company,  default  of  that  company  should  result  in  that  individual  being        considered  defaulted  as  well.  Where  such  full  liability  for  the  obligations  of  a  company  does        not  exist,  owners,  partners  or  significant  shareholders  of  a  defaulted  company  should  be        assessed  by  the  institution  for  possible  indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  with  regard  to  their        individual  obligations.          	1
102.    Additionally, in the specific case of an individual entrepreneur where an individual is fully    liable for both private and	commercial  obligations  with  both  private  and  commercial  assets        the  default  of  any  of  the  private  or  commercial  obligations  should  cause  all  private  and        commercial  obligations  of  such  individual  to  be  considered  as  defaulted  as  well.        	1
103.   Where the definition of default is applied at the level of an obligor for retail exposures,    the materiality threshold should	also  be  applied  at  the  level  of  an  obligor.  Institutions  should        clearly  specify  in  their  internal  policies  and  procedures  the  treatment  of  joint  credit        obligations  in  the  application  of  the  materiality  threshold.              	1
104.   A joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that have a joint obligation towards    an institution, should be	treated  as  a  different  obligor  from  each  of  the  individual  obligors.  In        the  case  the  delay  in  payment  occurs  on  a  joint  credit  obligation,  the  materiality  of  such  delay        should  be  assessed  by  applying  the  materiality  threshold  referred  to  in  point  (d)  of  Article        178(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  to  all  joint  credit  obligations  granted  to  this  specific        set  of  obligors.  For  this  purpose  the  individual  exposures  to  obligors  participating  in  a  joint  	1
105.   When delay in payment occurs on an individual credit obligation, the materiality of such    delay should be assessed by applying	the  materiality  threshold  referred  to  in  point  (d)  of        Article  178(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  to  all  individual  credit  obligations  of  this        obligor,  without  taking  into  account  any  joint  credit  obligations  of  that  obligor  with  other        individuals  or  entities.  Where  the  materiality  threshold  calculated  in  this  way  is  breached,  all        individual  exposures  to  this  obligor  should  be  considered  defaulted.  	1
106.   Institutions should have effective processes that allow them to obtain the relevant    information in order to identify defaults in a	timely  manner,  and  to  channel  the  relevant        information  in  the  shortest  possible  time  and,  where  possible,  in  an  automated  manner,  to        the  personnel  that  is  responsible  for  taking  credit  decisions,  and  more  in  particular:          	1
107.   Institutions should verify on a regular basis that all forborne non-performing exposures    are classified as default and subject to distressed	restructuring.  Institutions  should  also        analyse  on  a  regular  basis  the  forborne  performing  exposures  in  order  to  determine  whether        any  of  them  fulfils  the  indication  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  as  specified  in  Article  178(3)(d)  of        Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and  in  paragraphs  49  to  55.            	1
108.   Control mechanisms should ensure that the relevant information is used in the default    identification process immediately after being obtained. All	exposures  to  a  defaulted  obligor        or  all  relevant  exposures  in  case  of  the  application  of  the  definition  of  default  at  the  facility        level  for  retail  exposures  should  be  marked  as  defaulted  in  all  relevant  IT  systems  without    	1
109.    Institutions should document their policies regarding the definition of default including all    triggers for identification of default and the	exit  criteria  as  well  as  clear  identification  of  the        scope  of  application  of  the  definition  of  default  and,  more  in  particular  they  should:          	1
110.  For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 109 institutions should document the    application of the definition of default in a	detailed  manner  by  including  the        operationalization  of  all  indications  of  default,  including  the  process,  sources  of  information        and  responsibilities  for  the  identification  of  particular  indications  of  default.          	1
111.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 109 institutions should document the    operationalization of the criteria for reclassification of	a  defaulted  obligor  to  a  non-defaulted        status,  including  the  processes,  sources  of  information  and  responsibilities  assigned  to        relevant  personnel.            	1
112.   For the purposes of paragraphs 110 and 111 the documentation should include    description of all automatic mechanisms and manual processes,	and  where  qualitative        indications  of  default  or  criteria  for  the  return  to  non-defaulted  status  are  applied  manually        the  description  should  be  sufficiently  detailed  to  facilitate  common  understanding  and        consistent  application  by  all  responsible  personnel.    	1
113.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 109 institutions should keep an updated    register of all current and past	versions  of  the  default  definition  at  least  starting  from  the  date        of  application  of  these  guidelines.  This  register  should  include  at  least  the  following        information:              	1
114.   Institutions that use the IRB Approach should adopt adequate mechanisms and    procedures in order to ensure that the definition of	default  is  implemented  and  used  in  a        correct  manner,  and  should  in  particular  ensure  that:            	1
2.1      The business reorganisation plan should demonstrate with a high level of confidence that       	    its  application  will  restore  the  long-term  viability  of  the  institution  or  entity  referred  to  in      points  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU.  Such  demonstration  should      rely  on  credible  assumptions,  a  scenario-based  analysis  and  appropriate  and  concrete      performance  indicators  capturing  the  performance  of  the  entire  group,  the  entities  and      the  business  lines  that  are  not  to  be  wound  down  or  sold.            	1
2.2      Any assumptions and performance indicators should be compared with appropriate    sector-wide	benchmarks  and  should  be  in  line  with  available  macro-economic  forecasts.              	1
2.3      Where the business reorganisation plan sets out a description of how the institution or      	      entity  referred  to  in  points  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  will  be      able  to  provide  an  acceptable  financial  return,  such  return  should  be  assessed  by      comparison  to  relevant  peer  institutions  or  entities  and  historical  data.          	1
2.4      The risks taken into account by the viability analysis in the business reorganisation plan      	      should  be  consistent  with  institution-specific  and  broader  risks  identified  by  the      competent  authority,  the  central  bank  or  other  relevant  authority  or  institution  in  the      relevant  markets.          	1
2.5      The worst-case scenario should reflect a significant, albeit plausible, change in the  	  underlying  assumptions  in  comparison  to  the  base-case  scenario.  These  changes  should      focus  in  particular  on  the  assumptions  that  are  more  relevant  for  the  institution  under      reorganisation.              	1
2.6      Restoration of the long-term viability, even under the worst-case scenario, should not  	  involve  further  application  of  resolution  tools  beyond  the  scope  of  the  resolution  scheme      under  implementation  when  the  business  reorganisation  plan  was  drawn  up.  The      resolution  authority  should  also  ensure  that  the  reorganisation  of  the  institution  or  entity      does  not  give  rise  to  any  material  impediments  to  resolvability.  If  such  material      impediments  are  identified,  the  resolution  authority  should  notify  the  institution  or  entity      referred  to  in  points  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  according  to      the  procedure  set  out  in  Article  52(8)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  and  outline  relevant      actions  for  how  those  impediments  could  be  addressed.  	1
2.7      The business reorganisation plan should demonstrate that the institution or entity   	referred  to  in  points  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  is  capable  of              	1
2.8  In order to determine whether the business reorganisation plan is reasonably likely to     	            restore  the  long-term  viability  of  the  institution  or  entity  referred  to  in  points  (b),  (c)  and    	1
3.1  The information provided in the business reorganisation plan and its underlying       	        assumptions  regarding  the  causes  that  have  triggered  the  resolution  and  the          reorganisation  strategy  should  be  consistent  with  the  assessment  carried  out  by  the          resolution  authority  and  the  competent  authority  and  the  valuation  that  informed  the          determination  of  whether  the  conditions  for  resolution  were  met  in  accordance  with          Article  36(4)(a)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU.  	1
3.2  Any analysis of the external operating environment included in the business       	        reorganisation  plan  should  be  consistent  with  the  analysis  of  opportunities  and  threats  in          the  relevant  markets,  as  determined  by  the  resolution  authority  and  competent  authority          when  carrying  out  their  tasks.      	1
3.3  The business reorganisation plan should be feasible 	and realistic. In particular:       	1
       3.3.1    any internal and governance measures should be carried out taking into account   	            potential  implementation  impediments,  such  as  labour  law  or  other  contractual      requirements;          	1
       3.3.2    the reorganisation strategy, measures, milestones and performance indicators       	    contained  in  the  business  reorganisation  plan  should  take  into  account  the      interdependencies  between  the  legal  entities  and  business  lines  in  the  group.  These      might  include  commercial,  funding  and  operational  interdependencies;    	1
       3.3.3    the reorganisation strategy, the individual measures, the milestones and the     	        performance  indicators  contained  in  the  business  reorganisation  plan  should  take  into      account  the  situation  in  the  relevant  markets;              	1
      3.3.4   any divestment of assets, entities or business lines envisaged by the business     	    reorganisation  plan  should  be  tailored  to  the  situation  in  the  relevant  markets.  The  timing  and  scope  of  such  divestments  should  also  take  into  account  the  interest  and  possibility  of  investors  acquiring  them;        	1
      3.3.5   the benchmark or valuation used to calculate any expected proceeds from divestment     	    of  assets,  entities  or  business  lines  envisaged  by  the  business  reorganisation  plan  should  be  prudent,  reliable  and  realistic.        	1
3.4      The reorganisation period should be as short a	s possible, taking into account:  	1
4.1      The business reorganisation plan should be consistent with any business plans that have       	    been  prepared  by  the  institution  or  entity  and  submitted  to  any  other  authority  (e.g.      competition  or  securities  and  markets  authorities)  following  regulatory  or  legal      obligations.              	1
4.2      Where the Union State aid framework is applicable, the resolution authority and the       	    competent  authority,  when  assessing  the  business  reorganisation  plan,  should  cooperate      with  the  European  Commission  on  the  assessment  and  viability  analysis,  which  is  an      objective  of  both  the  business  reorganisation  plan  and  the  restructuring  plan.          	1
4.3      Where the business reorganisation plan includes measures already featuring in the latest  	  versions  of  previously  prepared  recovery  or  resolution  plans  for  the  institution  or  entity      referred  to  in  points  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU,  these  should      be  limited  to  elements  which  remain  relevant  following  that  institution’s  or  entity’s  failure      and  resolution  and  the  situation  in  the  relevant  markets.  	1
4.4      The reorganisation strategy should not undermine the resolution objectives and principles   	laid  down  in  Articles  31  and  34  of  Directive  2014/59/EU,  as  applied  by  the  resolution      authority.  The  resolution  authority  and  the  competent  authority  should  satisfy      themselves  that  implementation  of  the  reorganisation  strategy  and  measures  do  not      adversely  affect  the  critical  functions  of  the  institution  or  entity  referred  to  in  points  (b),    	1
5.1      Any milestones and performance indicators contained in the business reorganisation plan   	should  be  sufficiently  concrete  to  enable  their  monitoring,  in  accordance  with  the      reporting  obligations  referred  to  in  Article  52(10)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU.              	1
5.2      The content of the business reorganisation plan and the progress report should allow the      	      resolution  authority  and  the  competent  authority  to  conclude  that  the  business      reorganisation  plan  is  implemented  correctly  and  will  achieve  its  objectives.          	1
5.3      The resolution authority and the competent authority should ensure adequate    arrangements	in  order  to  carry  out  the  monitoring,  in  particular  in  relation  to  the  timely      flow  of  information  regarding  the  implementation  of  the  business  reorganisation  plan.        	1
5.4      Where the resolution authority or the competent authority appoints an independent   	expert  to  verify  in  full  or  in  part  the  assumptions  and  the  effect  of  the  measures      contemplated  by  the  business  reorganisation  plan,  such  independent  expert  should  meet      a  standard  of  independence  equivalent  to  the  criteria  for  independence  specified  by  Part      Five,  Title  I  of  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  [XXX/XXX]  supplementing  Directive      2014/59/EU  (Independence  of  valuers).      	1
1.1      The resolution authority and the competent authority should establish appropriate    working	arrangements  for  the  submission,  assessment  and  approval  of  business      reorganisation  plans.        	1
1.2      The indicative timeline of the envisaged actions should provide enough time for each       	    authority  to  assess  the  business  reorganisation  plan  after  its  submission,  but  also  allow      sufficient  time  for  each  authority  to  express  any  concern,  to  examine  the  concerns  raised      by  the  other  authority  and  agree  on  the  appropriate  action,  taking  into  account  the      deadlines  provided  in  Article  52(7)  to  -10  of  Directive  2014/59/EU.              	1
1.3      Both the resolution and the competent authorities should coordinate communication    and,	when  possible,  submit  one  joint  reply  to  the  institution  or  entity  referred  to  in  points    	1
1.4      The competent authority should provide its agreement to the approval of the business       	    reorganisation  plan  by  the  resolution  authority  in  writing.              	1
1.5      The resolution authority should share with the competent authority all the progress  	  reports  submitted  to  it  by  the  management  body  or  the  person  or  persons  appointed  in      accordance  with  Article  72(1)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  without  undue  delay.      	1
1.6      Following each submission of the progress report, the resolution and the competent  	  authorities  should  establish  working  arrangements  to  coordinate  and  share  their      assessment  and  communication  to  the  progress  report.  Such  arrangements  should      provide  time  for  each  authority  to  assess  the  progress  report,  but  also  allow  sufficient      time  for  each  authority  to  express  any  concerns  to  the  other  authority  and  for  the  latter      to  examine  such  concerns  and  agree  on  the  appropriate  action.        	1
1.7      When a disagreement between the two authorities cannot be resolved within the  	  timeline  established  by  Article  52(7)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU,  either  of  the  authorities      may  refer  the  issue  to  the  EBA  in  order  for  the  EBA  to  assist  the  authorities  to  reach  an      agreement  in  accordance  with  Article  31  of  the  EBA  Regulation.            	1
2.1      Where the institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of   	            Directive  2014/59/EU  under  resolution  have  activities  in  more  than  one  Member  State  or      in  jurisdictions  outside  the  EU,  the  relevant  resolution  authority,  before  approving  the      business  reorganisation  plan,  but  within  the  appropriate  timeframe  for  the  assessment,      should:      	1
       2.1.1    communicate the business reorganisation plan to the other resolution	  authorities  affected  by  the  reorganisation,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions    of  Article  52(2)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU,  even  if  they  are  in  jurisdictions    outside  the  EU,  in  accordance  with  existing  cooperation  arrangements  or  with    existing  assessments  of  confidentiality  equivalence;      	1
       2.1.2    consider communicating the business reorganisation plan to that institution	  or  entity’s  resolution  college  or  European  resolution  college;  	1
       2.1.3    provide the resolution authorities referred to in points 2.1.1	and  2.1.2  above    with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  business  reorganisation  plan  and    take  their  comments  into  account,  to  the  extent  possible.            	1
2.2      Where the institutions or entities referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 1(1) of   	            Directive  2014/59/EU  under  resolution  have  activities  in  more  than  one  Member  State  or      jurisdictions  outside  the  EU,  the  relevant  competent  authority,  before  communicating  its      approval  on  the  business  reorganisation  plan  to  the  resolution  authority,  but  within  the      appropriate  timeframe  for  the  assessment,  should:        	1
       2.2.1    communicate the business reorganisation plan to the other competent	  authorities  affected  by  the  reorganisation  in  accordance  with  the  provisions    of  Article  52(2)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU,  even  if  they  are  in  jurisdictions    outside  the  EU,  in  accordance  with  existing  cooperation  arrangements  or  with    existing  assessments  of  confidentiality  equivalence;      	1
       2.2.2    consider communicating the business reorganisation plan to the other	  members  of  that  institution’s  or  entity’s  college  of  supervisors;              	1
       2.2.3    provide the competent authorities referred to in points 2.2.1	and  2.2.2  above    with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  business  reorganisation  plan  and    take  their  comments  into  account,  to  the  extent  possible.            	1
2.3      When the bail-in tool is applied to two or more group entities in different Member States,    	          the  relevant  resolution  authorities  and  competent  authorities  should  cooperate  in  the      assessment  and  approval  of  the  business  reorganisation  plan.          	1
3. When assessing whether there is a material threat to financial stability arising from or    aggravated by the failure or likely failure of	the  institution  under  resolution  in  the  context  of        the  requirement  to  market  the  institution  relating  to  the  application  of  the  sale  of  business        tool,  resolution  authorities  should  consider  the  impact  on  other  institutions  and  financial        markets  including  infrastructure  providers  and  non-financial  institution  customers.  Resolution        authorities  should  in  particular  consider,  but  not  limit  themselves  to,  factual  circumstances        that  are  relevant  for  the  risk  that  marketing  the  institution  under  resolution  may  result  in        aggravating  uncertainty  and  a  loss  of  market  confidence.  These  circumstances  should  include        at  least  any  of  the  following:          	1
4. Resolution authorities should assess the likelihood of an imminent impairment to any of these    elements which could affect institutions other than the	institution  under  resolution  that  are        relevant  with  respect  to  the  financial  stability  of  one  or  more  Member  States  based  on  their        relevance  as  individuals  and  collectively,  as  appropriate.        	1
5. When assessing whether compliance with the requirements specified in Article 39(1) of    Directive 2014/59/EU would be likely to undermine the effectiveness of	the  sale  of  business        tool  or  achieving  the  resolution  objective  of  avoiding  significant  adverse  effects  on  financial        stability,  resolution  authorities  should  consider  at  least  the  following  elements:          	1
6. When the resolution authority assesses the need to effect a rapid resolution action in    accordance with point (e) of Directive 2014/59/EU, it	should  pay  particular  regard  to  the        continuance  of  critical  functions,  the  confidence  of  depositors  and  the  public,  the  functioning        of  infrastructures  and  the  trading  times  in  relevant  markets.        	1
17. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a manner that is appropriate to     their size and internal organisation and the	nature,  scope  and  complexity  of  their  activities          and  portfolios,  and,  more  generally,  all  other  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  credit          institution  (and  the  group  (if  any)  to  which  it  belongs).  The  use  of  properly  designed          proportionate  approaches  should  not  jeopardise  the  high-quality  implementation  of  the  ECL          accounting  frameworks.  	1
18. Credit institutions should also give due consideration to the application of the principle of     materiality. However, this should not result in	individual  exposures  or  portfolios  being          considered  immaterial  if,  cumulatively,  these  represent  a  material  exposure  to  the  credit          institution.  In  addition,  materiality  should  not  be  assessed  only  on  the  basis  of  the  potential          impact  on  the  profit  or  loss  statement  at  the  reporting  date.  For  instance,  large  portfolio(s)  of          lending  exposures  such  as  real  estate  mortgages  would  generally  be  considered  material  even          if  they  are  highly  collateralised.  	1
19. In considering how to take proportionality or materiality into account in the design of an ECL     methodology or in its implementation,	it  is  important  to  ensure  that  bias  is  not  being          introduced.    	1
20. The timely recognition of credit deterioration and allowances should not be delayed without     prejudice to the fact that ECL accounting frameworks	are  symmetrical  in  the  way  that          subsequent  changes  (both  deteriorations  and  reversals  of  those  deteriorations)  in  the  credit          risk  profile  of  a  debtor  should  be  considered  in  the  measurement  of  the  allowances.          	1
21. Credit institutions should consider a wide range of information when applying ECL accounting     models. Information considered should be relevant to the	assessment  of  credit  risk  and          measurement  of  ECL  of  the  particular  lending  exposure  being  assessed,  and  should  include          information  about  past  events,  current  conditions  and  forecasts  of  future  economic          conditions.  Information  which  is  ultimately  included  in  the  assessment  of  credit  risk  and          measurement  of  ECL  should  also  be  reasonable  and  supportable.  Credit  institutions  should          use  their  experienced  credit  judgement  in  determining  the  range  of  relevant  information  that              	1
     should be considered and in determining whether information is considered to be reasonable      and supportable. Reasonable	and  supportable  information  should  be  based  on  relevant  facts            and  sound  judgement.              	1
22. In order to ensure a timely recognition of credit losses, credit institutions should consider     forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. When considering	forwardlooking  information,  credit  institutions  should  apply  sound  judgement  consistent  with          generally  accepted  methods  for  economic  analysis  and  forecasting,  and  supported  by  a          sufficient  set  of  data.        	1
23. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate how they have considered relevant,     reasonable and supportable information in the ECL assessment and	measurement  process.          Credit  institutions  should  apply  experienced  credit  judgement  in  the  consideration  of  future          scenarios  and  take  into  account  the  potential  consequence  of  events  occurring  or  not          occurring,  and  the  resulting  impact  on  the  measurement  of  ECL.  Information  should  not  be          excluded  from  that  process  simply  because  an  event  has  a  low  likelihood  of  occurring  or  the          effect  of  that  event  on  the  credit  risk  or  the  amount  of  expected  credit  losses  is  uncertain.  In          certain  circumstances  information  relevant  to  the  assessment  and  measurement  of  credit  risk          may  not  be  reasonable  and  supportable  and  should  therefore  be  excluded  from  the  ECL          assessment  and  measurement  process.  Given  that  these  circumstances  would  be  exceptional          in  nature,  credit  institutions  should  provide  a  clearly  documented,  robust  justification.          	1
24. The information used shall include an unbiased consideration of relevant factors and their     impact on creditworthiness and cash shortfalls. Relevant factors	include  those  intrinsic  to  the          bank  and  its  business  or  derived  from  external  conditions.            	1
The management body 21 and senior management of a credit institution are responsible for ensuring that the credit institution has appropriate credit risk management practices, including	an  effective  internal  control  system,  to  consistently  determine  adequate  allowances  in  accordance  with  the  credit  institution’s  stated  policies  and  procedures,  the  applicable  accounting  framework  and  relevant  supervisory  guidance.      	1
21    Various management body structures can be observed in EU Member States. In some Member States a single-tier structure is common, i.e. supervisory	and  management  functions  of  the  management  body  are  exercised  within  a  single  body.  In  other  Member  States  a  two-tier  structure  is  common,  with  two  independent  bodies  being  established,  one  for  the  management  function  and  the  other  for  the  supervision  of  the  management  function.    	1
25. The credit institution’s management body should be responsible for approving and regularly     reviewing a credit institution’s credit risk management strategy and	the  main  policies  and          processes  for  identifying,  measuring,  evaluating,  monitoring,  reporting  and  mitigating  credit          risk  consistent  with  the  approved  risk  appetite  set  by  the  management  body.  In  addition,  to          limit  the  risk  that  lending  exposures  pose  to  depositors  and,  more  generally,  financial  stability,          a  credit  institution’s  management  body  should  require  that  senior  management  adopt  and          adhere  to  sound  underwriting  practices  22.            	1
26. To fulfil these responsibilities, the management body should instru    	ct senior management to:   	1
a. develop and maintain appropriate processes, which should be systematic and consistently    applied, to determine appropriate allowances in accordance with the applicable accounting	      framework;            	1
b. establish and implement an effective internal control system for credit risk assessment and    measurement; report periodically the results of the credit risk	assessment  and  measurement        processes,  including  estimates  of  its  ECL  allowances;        	1
c. establish, implement and, as necessary, update suitable policies and procedures to    communicate the credit risk assessment and measurement process internally to all	relevant        staff,  in  particular  staff  members  who  are  involved  in  that  process.    	1
     Senior management should be responsible for implementing the credit risk strategy approved      by the management body	and  developing  the  aforementioned  policies  and  processes.      	1
27. An effective internal control system for credit risk assessment	 and measurement should     include:  	1
a. measures to comply with applicable laws, regulations, intern  	al policies and procedures;      	1
b. measures to provide oversight of the integrity of information used and reasonably ensure that    the allowances reflected in the credit institution’s financial	statements  and  reports  submitted        to  the  competent  authority  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  accounting        framework  and  relevant  supervisory  requirements;        	1
c. well-defined credit risk assessment and measurement processes that are independent from   	 (while taking appropriate account of) the lending function, which contain: 	1
  i.    an effective credit risk rating system that is consistently applied, accurately grades  	          differentiating  by  credit  risk  characteristics,  identifies  changes  in  credit  risk  on  a  timely  basis,  and  prompts  appropriate  action;  22        The  Financial  Stability  Board  published  Principles  for  sound  residential  mortgage  underwriting  practices  in  April  2012  which  aim  to  provide  a  framework  for  jurisdictions  to  set  minimum  acceptable  underwriting  standards  for  real  estate  lending  exposures;  available  at  www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_120418.pdf.  The  EBA  has  published  Guidelines  on  creditworthiness  assessment  (EBA/GL/2015/11)  which  are  aligned  with  the  FSB  Principles  and  cover  some  of  them.    	1
    ii.    an effective process to ensure that all relevant and reasonable and supportable	      information,  including  forward-looking  information,  is  appropriately  considered  in        assessing  credit  risk  and  measuring  ECL.  This  includes  maintaining  appropriate        reports,  details  of  reviews  performed,  and  identification  and  descriptions  of  the  roles        and  responsibilities  of  staff  involved;          	1
   iii.    an assessment policy that ensures ECL measurement occurs at the individual lending 	    exposure  level  and  also,  when  necessary  to  appropriately  measure  ECL  in  accordance        with  the  applicable  accounting  framework,  at  the  collective  portfolio  level  by        grouping  exposures  based  on  identified  shared  credit  risk  characteristics;          	1
   iv.     an effective model validation process to ensure that the credit risk assessment	and        measurement  models  are  able  to  generate  accurate,  consistent  and  unbiased        predictive  estimates,  on  an  ongoing  basis.  This  includes  establishing  policies  and        procedures  which  set  out  the  accountability  and  reporting  structure  of  the  model        validation  process,  internal  rules  for  assessing  and  approving  changes  to  the  models,        and  reporting  of  the  outcome  of  the  model  validation;      	1
    v.     clear formal communication and coordination among a credit institution’s credit risk	      staff,  financial  reporting  staff,  senior  management,  the  management  body  and  others        who  are  involved  in  the  credit  risk  assessment  and  ECL  measurement  process.  This        should  be  evidenced  by  written  policies  and  procedures,  management  reports  and        minutes  of  committees  involved  such  as  management  body  or  senior  management        committees;  and      	1
d. an internal audit 23 fu	nction that:       	1
    i.     independently evaluates the effectiveness of the credit institution’s credit risk 	    assessment  and  measurement  systems  and  processes,  including  the  credit  risk  rating        system;  and            	1
    ii.    makes recommendations on addressing any weaknesses identified during this   	              evaluation.    	1
      Credit institutions should adopt, document and adhere to policies which include sound       methodologies, procedures	and  controls  for  assessing  and  measuring  credit  risk  on  all  lending              exposures.  The  measurement  of  allowances  should  build  upon  those  methodologies  and  result              in  the  appropriate  and  timely  recognition  of  ECL  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  accounting              framework.      	1
28. The credit risk assessment and measurement process should provide the relevant information     for senior management to make its experienced judgements about	the  credit  risk  of  lending          exposures,  and  the  related  estimation  of  ECL.  	1
29. Credit institutions should, to the maximum extent possible, leverage and integrate common     processes, systems, tools and data that are used within	a  credit  institution  to  determine  if,          when,  and  on  what  terms,  credit  should  be  granted;  monitor  credit  risk;  and  measure          allowances  for  both  accounting  and  capital  adequacy  purposes.    	1
30. A credit institution’s allowance methodologies should clearly document the definitions of key     terms related to the assessment of credit risk and	ECL  measurement  (such  as  loss  and          migration  rates,  loss  events  and  default).  Where  different  terms,  information  or  assumptions          are  used  across  functional  areas  (such  as  accounting,  capital  adequacy  and  credit  risk          management),  the  underlying  rationale  for  these  differences  should  be  documented  and          approved  by  senior  management.  Information  and  assumptions  used  for  ECL  estimates  should          be  reviewed  and  updated  as  required  by  the  applicable  accounting  framework.    	1
31. Credit institutions should have in place adequate processes and systems to appropriately     identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and mitigate the level	of  credit  risk.  During  the          transition  to  the  ECL  accounting  model,  existing  processes  and  systems  should  be  evaluated          and,  if  necessary,  modified  to  collect  and  analyse  relevant  information  affecting  the          assessment  of  credit  risk  and  ECL  measurement.      	1
32. Credit institutions should adopt and adhere to written policies and procedures detailing the     credit risk systems and controls used in their	credit  risk  methodologies,  and  the  separate  roles          and  responsibilities  of  the  credit  institution’s  management  body  and  senior  management.    	1
33. Sound methodologies for assessing credit risk and measuring the level of allowances (subject     to exposure type, for example retail or wholesale)	should,  in  particular:              	1
a. include a robust process that is designed to equip the credit institution with the ability to    identify the level, nature and drivers	of  credit  risk  upon  initial  recognition  of  the  lending        exposure,  to  ensure  that  subsequent  changes  in  credit  risk  can  be  identified  and  quantified;          	1
b. include criteria to duly consider the impact of forward-looking information, including    macroeconomic factors. Whether the evaluation of credit risk is conducted on	a  collective  or        individual  basis,  a  credit  institution  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  this  consideration  has        occurred  so  that  the  recognition  of  ECL  is  not  delayed.  Such  criteria  should  result  in  the        identification  of  factors  that  affect  repayment,  whether  related  to  borrower  incentives,        willingness  or  ability  to  perform  on  the  contractual  obligations,  or  lending  exposure  terms  and        conditions.  Economic  factors  considered  (such  as  unemployment  rates  or  occupancy  rates)        should  be  relevant  to  the  assessment  and,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  this  may  be  at        the  international,  national,  regional  or  local  level;      	1
c. include, for collectively evaluated exposures, a description of the basis for creating groups of  	  portfolios of exposures with shared credit risk characteristics;	1
d. identify and document the ECL assessment and measurement methods (such as a loss rate    method, probability of default (PD)/loss-given-default (LGD) method, or	another  method)  to        be  applied  to  each  exposure  or  portfolio;        	1
e. document the reasons why the selected method is appropriate, especially if different ECL    measurement methods are applied to different portfolios and types	of  individual  exposures.        Credit  institutions  should  be  able  to  explain  to  the  competent  authorities  the  rationale  for  any        changes  in  measurement  approach  (for  example,  a  move  from  a  loss  rate  method  to  a        PD/LGD  method)  and  the  quantitative  impacts  of  such  changes;  	1
f.   	document:          	1
       i.     the inputs, data and assumptions used in the allowance estimation process, such as 	            historical  loss  rates,  PD/LGD  estimates  and  economic  forecasts;      	1
       ii.    how the life of an exposure or portfolio is determined (including how expected  	          prepayments  and  defaults  have  been  considered);            	1
      iii.    the time period over which historical l	oss experience is evaluated;      	1
      iv.     any adjustments necessary for the estimation of ECL in accordance with the   	        applicable  accounting  framework.  For  example,  if  current  and  forecasted  economic  conditions  are  different  from  those  that  existed  during  the  historical  estimation  period  being  used,  adjustments  that  are  directionally  consistent  with  those  differences  should  be  made.  In  addition,  a  credit  institution  may  have  experienced  little  to  no  actual  losses  in  the  historical  period  analysed;  however,  current  or  forward-looking  conditions  can  differ  from  conditions  during  the  historical  period,  and  the  impact  of  these  changes  on  ECL  should  be  assessed  and  measured;        	1
g. include a process for evaluating the appropriateness of significant inputs and assumptions in    the ECL measurement method chosen. The basis for inputs	and  assumptions  used  in  the        process  of  the  estimation  of  allowances  should  generally  be  consistent  from  period  to  period.        Where  the  inputs  and  assumptions  or  the  basis  for  these  change,  the  rationale  should  be        documented;  	1
h. identify the situations that would generally lead to changes in ECL measurement methods,    inputs or assumptions from period to period (for example,	a  credit  institution  may  state  that  a        loan  that  had  been  previously  evaluated  on  a  collective  basis  using  a  PD/LGD  method  may  be        removed  and  evaluated  individually  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  upon  receipt  of        new,  borrower-specific  information  such  as  the  loss  of  employment);          	1
i.   consider the relevant internal and external factors that may affect ECL estimates, such as the      underwriting standards applied	to  a  lending  exposure  at  origination  and  changes  in  industry,            geographical,  economic  and  political  factors;        	1
j.   address how ECL estimates are determined (for example historical loss rates or migration      analysis as a starting point,	adjusted  for  information  on  current  and  expected  conditions).  A            credit  institution  should  have  an  unbiased  view  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  in  its  lending            activities  when  estimating  ECL;              	1
k. identify what factors are considered when establishing appropriate historical time periods    over which to evaluate historical loss experience. A credit institution should	maintain        sufficient  historical  loss  data  to  provide  a  meaningful  analysis  of  its  credit  loss  experience  for        use  as  a  starting  point  when  estimating  the  level  of  allowances  on  a  collective  or  individual        basis;      	1
l.   determine the extent to which the value of collateral and other credit 	risk mitigants affects      ECL;  	1
m. outline the credit institution’s policies and procedures on      	write-offs and recoveries;   	1
n. require that analyses, estimates, reviews and other tasks/processes that are inputs to or    outputs from the credit risk assessment and measurement process	are  performed  by        competent  and  well-trained  staff  and  validated  by  staff  who  are  independent  of  the  credit        institution’s  lending  activities.  These  inputs  to  and  outputs  from  these  functions  should  be        well  documented,  and  the  documentation  should  include  clear  explanations  supporting  the        analyses,  estimates  and  reviews;    	1
o. document the methods used to validate models for ECL measuremen	t (for example    backtests);   	1
p. ensure that ECL estimates appropriately incorporate forward-looking information, including    macroeconomic factors, that has not already been factored into allowances measured on an	      individual  exposure  basis.  This  may  require  management  to  use  its  experienced  credit        judgement  to  consider  broad  trends  in  the  entire  lending  portfolio,  changes  in  the  credit        institution’s  business  model,  macroeconomic  factors,  etc.;  and      	1
34. A credit institution’s credit risk identification process should ensure that factors that impact     changes in credit risk and estimates of ECL	are  properly  identified  on  a  regular  basis.  In          addition,  consideration  of  credit  risk  inherent  in  new  products  and  activities  should  be  a  key          part  of  the  credit  risk  identification  process,  the  assessment  of  credit  risk  and  measurement          of  ECL.  	1
35. Senior management should consider relevant facts and circumstances, including forwardlooking information, that are likely to cause ECL to differ from historical experience and that 	      may  affect  credit  risk  and  the  full  collectability  of  cash  flows.      	1
36. With respect to factors related to the character, capacity and capital of borrowers, the terms     of lending exposures, and the values	of  assets  pledged  as  collateral  together  with  other  credit          risk  mitigants  that  may  affect  the  full  collectability  of  cash  flows,  a  credit  institution  should          (depending  on  the  type  of  exposure)  consider:            	1
37. Where they have the potential to affect the credit institution’s ability to recover amounts     due, credit institutions should consider factors relating	to  the  credit  institution’s  business          model  and  current  and  forecasted  macroeconomic  conditions,  including  but  not  limited  to:      	1
24   Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/79 of 18 December 2014 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to	supervisory  reporting  of  institutions  according  to  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  as  regards  asset  encumbrance,  single  data  point  model  and  validation  rules.    	1
38. Sound credit risk methodologies should consider different potential scenarios and should not     rely purely on subjective, biased or overly optimistic considerations.	Credit  institutions  should          develop  and  document  their  processes  to  generate  relevant  scenarios  to  be  used  in  the          estimation  of  ECL.  In  particular:  	1
39. While a credit institution does not need to identify or model every possible scenario through     scenario simulations, it should consider all	reasonable  and  supportable  information  that  is          relevant  to  the  product,  borrower,  business  model  or  economic  and  regulatory  environment    	1
40. Senior management should be able to demonstrate that it understands and appropriately     considers inherent risks when pricing lending exposures. Credit institutions	should  take          particular  care  of  the  following  fact  patterns,  which  are  potentially  indicative  of  inadequate          estimates  of  ECL:          	1
41. Credit institutions’ accounting policies should address, and their allowance methodology    	 should include, criteria for (a) renegotiations/modifications of lending exposures due to	1
42. As part of its credit risk assessment process, credit institutions should have in place     comprehensive procedures and information systems to monitor	the  quality  of  their  lending          exposures.  These  include  an  effective  credit  risk  rating  process  that  captures  the  varying  level,          nature  and  drivers  of  credit  risk  that  may  manifest  themselves  over  time,  in  order  to          reasonably  ensure  that  all  lending  exposures  are  properly  monitored  and  that  ECL  allowances          are  appropriately  measured.              	1
43. The credit risk rating process should include an independent review function. Initial     assignment of credit risk grades to exposures and their	ongoing  updating  by  front-line  lending          staff  should  be  subject  to  the  review  of  the  independent  review  function.      	1
44. Credit institutions should take into account a number of criteria when assigning the credit risk     grade upon initial recognition of a	lending  exposure  including,  to  the  extent  relevant,  product          type,  terms  and  conditions,  collateral  type  and  amount,  borrower  characteristics  and          geography  or  a  combination  thereof.            	1
45. When changing existing credit risk grades assigned, on either a portfolio or an individual basis,     credit institutions should take into account	other  relevant  factors  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,          changes  in  industry  outlook,  business  growth  rates,  consumer  sentiment  and  changes  in          economic  forecasts  (such  as  interest  rates,  unemployment  rates  and  commodity  prices)  as          well  as  weaknesses  in  underwriting  identified  after  initial  recognition.          	1
46. The credit risk rating system should capture all lending exposures when assessing the impact     of changes in credit risk, and not	only  those  that  may  have  experienced  significant  increases          in  credit  risk,  have  incurred  losses  or  are  otherwise  credit  impaired.  This  is  to  allow  for  an          appropriate  differentiation  of  credit  risk  and  grouping  of  lending  exposures  within  the  credit          risk  rating  system,  and  to  reflect  the  risk  of  individual  exposures  as  well  as,  when  aggregated          across  all  exposures,  the  level  of  credit  risk  in  the  portfolio  as  a  whole.  In  this  context,  an          effective  credit  risk  rating  system  should  allow  credit  institutions  to  identify  both  migration  of          credit  risk  and  significant  changes  in  credit  risk.        	1
47. Credit institutions should describe the elements of their credit risk rating system, clearly     defining each credit risk grade and designating the	staff  responsible  for  the  design,          implementation,  operation  and  performance  of  the  system  as  well  as  those  responsible  for          periodic  testing  and  validation  (i.e.  the  independent  review  function).      	1
48. Credit risk grades should be reviewed whenever relevant new information is received or a     credit institution’s expectation of credit risk has	changed.  Credit  risk  grades  assigned  should        	1
49. Credit institutions should group exposures with shared credit risk characteristics in a way that     is sufficiently granular to be able to	reasonably  assess  changes  in  credit  risk  and  thus  the          impact  on  the  estimate  of  ECL  for  these  groups.    	1
50. A credit institution’s methodology for grouping exposures to assess credit risk (such as by     instrument type, product terms and conditions, industry/market	segment,  geographical          location  or  vintages)  should  be  documented  and  subject  to  appropriate  review  and  internal          approval  by  senior  management.        	1
51. Lending exposures should be grouped according to shared credit risk characteristics so that     changes in the level of credit risk respond	to  the  impact  of  changing  conditions  on  a  common          range  of  credit  risk  drivers.  This  includes  considering  the  effect  on  the  group’s  credit  risk  in          response  to  changes  in  forward-looking  information,  including  macroeconomic  factors.  The          basis  of  grouping  should  be  reviewed  by  senior  management  to  ensure  that  exposures  within          the  group  remain  homogeneous  in  terms  of  their  response  to  credit  risk  drivers  and  that  the          relevant  credit  risk  characteristics  and  their  impact  on  the  level  of  credit  risk  for  the  group          have  not  changed  over  time.          	1
52. Exposures should not be grouped in such a way that an increase in the credit risk of particular     exposures is obscured	by  the  performance  of  the  group  as  a  whole.  	1
53. Credit institutions should have in place a robust process to ensure appropriate initial grouping     of their lending exposures. Subsequently, the grouping	of  exposures  should  be  re-evaluated          and  exposures  should  be  re-segmented  if  relevant  new  information  is  received  or  a  credit          institution’s  changed  expectations  of  credit  risk  suggest  that  a  permanent  adjustment  is          warranted.  If  a  credit  institution  is  not  able  to  re-segment  exposures  on  a  timely  basis,  a          temporary  adjustment  should  be  used.          	1
54. Credit institutions should use temporary adjustments to an allowance only as an interim     solution, in particular in transient circumstances or when	there  is  insufficient  time  to          appropriately  incorporate  relevant  new  information  into  the  existing  credit  risk  rating  and          modelling  process,  or  to  re-segment  existing  groups  of  lending  exposures,  or  when  lending          exposures  within  a  group  of  lending  exposures  react  to  factors  or  events  differently  than          initially  expected.        	1
55. Such adjustments should not be continuously used over the long term for a non-transient risk     factor. If the reason for the	adjustment  is  not  expected  to  be  temporary,  such  as  the          emergence  of  a  new  risk  driver  that  has  not  previously  been  incorporated  into  the          institution’s  allowance  methodology,  the  methodology  should  be  updated  in  the  near  term  to          incorporate  the  factor  that  is  expected  to  have  an  ongoing  impact  on  the  measurement  of          ECL.        	1
56. The use of temporary adjustments requires the application of significant judgement and     creates the potential for bias. In order to avoid	the  creation  of  potential  for  bias,  temporary          adjustments  should  be  directionally  consistent  with  forward-looking  forecasts,  supported  by          appropriate  documentation,  and  subject  to  appropriate  governance  processes.          	1
57. Credit institutions should implement sound credit risk methodologies with the objective that     the overall balance of the allowance for ECL is	developed  in  accordance  with  the  applicable          accounting  framework  and  adequately  reflects  ECL  within  that  framework.          	1
58. When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account     relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date	that  may  affect  the  collectability  of          remaining  cash  flows  over  the  life  of  a  group  of  lending  exposures  or  a  single  lending          exposure.  Credit  institutions  should  consider  information  which  goes  beyond  historical  and          current  data,  and  take  into  account  reasonable  and  supportable  forward-looking  information,          including  macroeconomic  factors,  that  are  relevant  to  the  exposure(s)  being  evaluated  (for          example  retail  or  wholesale)  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  accounting  framework.              	1
59. Depending on the ability to incorporate forward-looking information into the ECL estimate,     credit institutions may use individual or collective assessment approaches;	regardless  of  the          assessment  approach  used,  they  should  be  consistent  with  the  relevant  accounting          requirements  and  not  result  in  materially  different  allowance  measurements.  Together,          individual  and  collective  assessments  form  the  basis  for  the  allowance  for  ECL.        	1
60. The ECL assessment approach used should be the most appropriate in the particular     circumstances, and typically should be aligned with how	the  credit  institution  manages  the          lending  exposure.  For  example,  collective  assessment  is  often  used  for  large  groups  of          homogeneous  lending  exposures  with  shared  credit  risk  characteristics,  such  as  retail          portfolios.  Individual  assessments  are  often  conducted  for  significant  exposures,  or  where          credit  concerns  have  been  identified  at  the  individual  loan  level,  such  as  watch  list  and  past          due  loans.    	1
61. Regardless of the assessment approach it uses (individual or collective), a credit institution     should ensure this does not result in delayed	recognition  of  ECL.              	1
62. When credit institutions use individual assessments, the ECL estimate should always     incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking	        information,  including  macroeconomic  factors,  that  affect  collectability  and  credit  risk.  When          applying  an  individual  assessment  approach,  in  the  same  manner  as  in  the  case  of  collective          assessment,  the  credit  institution’s  documentation  should  clearly  demonstrate  how  forwardlooking  information,  including  macroeconomic  factors,  has  been  reflected  in  the  individual          assessment.      	1
63. In cases when a credit institution’s individual assessments of exposures do not adequately     consider forward-looking information, and in order to allow	identification  of  relationships          between  forward-looking  information  and  ECL  estimates  that  may  not  be  apparent  at  the          individual  level,  an  institution  should  group  lending  exposures  with  shared  credit  risk          characteristics  to  estimate  the  impact  of  forward-looking  information,  including          macroeconomic  factors.  Conversely,  when  credit  institutions  determine  that  all  reasonable          and  supportable  forward-looking  information  has  been  incorporated  in  the  individual          assessment  of  ECL,  an  additional  forward-looking  assessment  should  not  be  conducted  on  a          collective  basis  if  that  could  result  in  double  counting.  	1
64. Credit institutions may use in the ECL assessment and measurement process models and     assumption-based estimates for risk identification and measurement, at	both  the  individual          lending  exposure  and  overall  portfolio  levels,  including  credit  grading,  credit  risk          identification,  measurement  of  ECL  allowances  for  accounting  purposes,  stress  testing  and          capital  allocation.  Models  used  in  the  ECL  assessment  and  measurement  process  should          consider  the  impact  of  changes  to  borrower  and  credit  risk-related  variables  such  as  changes          in  PDs,  LGDs,  exposure  amounts,  collateral  values,  migration  of  default  probabilities  and          internal  borrower  credit  risk  grades  based  on  historical,  current,  and  reasonable  and          supportable  forward-looking  information,  including  macroeconomic  factors.            	1
65. Credit institutions should have robust policies and procedures in place to appropriately     validate the accuracy and consistency of the models used	to  assess  the  credit  risk  and          measure  ECL,  including  their  model-based  credit  risk  rating  systems  and  processes  and  the          estimation  of  all  relevant  risk  components,  at  the  outset  of  model  usage  and  on  an  ongoing          basis.  Such  policies  and  procedures  should  appropriately  include  the  role  of  professional          judgement.    	1
66. Model validation should be conducted when the ECL models are initially developed and when     significant changes are made to the models,	and  should  ensure  that  the  models  are  suitable          for  their  proposed  usage  on  an  ongoing  basis.        	1
67. A sound model validation framework should include, but not be limited to, t  	he following     elements:    	1
68. Credit institutions should have the necessary tools to ensure a robust estimate and timely     recognition of ECL. Given that information on	historical  loss  experience  or  the  impact  of          current  conditions  may  not  fully  reflect  the  credit  risk  in  lending  exposures,  credit  institutions          should  use  their  experienced  credit  judgement  to  thoroughly  incorporate  the  expected          impact  of  all  reasonable  and  supportable  forward-looking  information,  including          macroeconomic  factors,  on  its  estimate  of  ECL.  A  credit  institution’s  use  of  its  experienced          credit  judgement  should  be  documented  in  the  credit  institution’s  credit  risk  methodology          and  subject  to  appropriate  oversight.          	1
69. Historical information provides a useful basis for the identification of trends and correlations     needed to identify the credit risk drivers for	lending  exposures.  However,  ECL  estimates  must          not  ignore  the  impact  of  (forward-looking)  events  and  conditions  on  those  drivers.  The          estimate  should  reflect  the  expected  future  cash  shortfalls  resulting  from  such  impact.            	1
70. Consideration of forward-looking information should not be avoided on the basis that a credit     institution considers the cost of incorporating such	forward-looking  information  to  be  very          high  or  unnecessary  or  because  there  is  uncertainty  in  formulating  forward-looking  scenarios,          unless  the  additional  cost  and  operational  burden  to  be  introduced  do  not  contribute  to  a          high-quality  implementation  of  an  ECL  accounting  framework.  	1
71. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that the forward-looking information     factored into the ECL estimation process has a link to	the  credit  risk  drivers  for  particular          exposures  or  portfolios.  Given  that  it  may  not  be  possible  to  demonstrate  a  strong  link  in          formal  statistical  terms  between  certain  types  of  information,  or  even  the  information  set  as  a          whole,  and  the  credit  risk  drivers,  credit  institutions  should  use  their  experienced  credit          judgement  in  establishing  an  appropriate  level  for  the  individual  or  collective  allowance.          When  a  forward-looking  factor  that  has  been  identified  as  relevant  is  not  incorporated  into          the  individual  or  collective  assessment,  temporary  adjustments  may  be  necessary.          	1
72. Macroeconomic forecasts and other relevant information should be applied consistently     across portfolios where the credit risk drivers of the portfolios are	affected  by  these          forecasts/assumptions  in  the  same  way.  Furthermore,  when  developing  ECL  estimates,  credit          institutions  should  apply  their  experienced  credit  judgement  to  consider  their  point  in  the          credit  cycle,  which  may  differ  across  the  jurisdictions  in  which  they  have  lending  exposures.            	1
73. Credit institutions should exercise care when determining the level of ECL allowances to be     recognised for accounting purposes, to ensure that	the  resulting  estimates  are  appropriate          (i.e.  consistent  with  neutrality  and  neither  understated  nor  overstated).            	1
74. Additionally, credit institutions should avail themselves of a wide range of information     derived in the credit risk management process, including that	of  a  forward-looking  nature  for          risk  management  and  capital  adequacy  purposes,  in  developing  their  estimate  of  ECL.      	1
75. To the maximum extent possible, credit institutions should use common processes, systems,     tools and data to assess credit risk, measure ECL	for  accounting  purposes  and  determine          expected  losses  for  capital  adequacy  purposes  in  order  to  strengthen  the  reliability  and          consistency  of  the  resulting  ECL  estimates,  increase  transparency  and,  through  market          discipline,  provide  incentives  to  follow  sound  credit  risk  practices.    	1
76. Credit risk practices should be reviewed periodically to ensure that relevant data available     throughout a credit institution’s organisation are captured and	that  systems  are  updated  as          the  credit  institution’s  underwriting  or  business  practices  change  or  evolve  over  time.  A          feedback  loop  should  be  established  to  ensure  that  information  on  estimates  of  ECL,  changes          in  credit  risk  and  actual  losses  experienced  on  lending  exposures  is  shared  among  credit  risk          experts,  accounting  and  regulatory  reporting  staff,  and  in  particular  with  the  loan          underwriting  staff.            	1
77. The common processes, systems, tools and data mentioned above could include credit risk     rating systems, estimated PDs (subject to appropriate adjustments),	past-due  status,  loan-tovalue  ratios,  historical  loss  rates,  product  type,  amortisation  schedule,  down  payment          requirements,  market  segment,  geographical  location,  vintage  (i.e.  date  of  origination)  and          collateral  type.        	1
78. The objective of public disclosures is to provide decision-useful information on a credit     institution’s financial position and performance, and changes therein,	to  a  wide  range  of  users          in  a  clear  and  understandable  manner.  Credit  institutions  should  aim  to  provide  information          that  is  relevant  and  comparable  so  that  users  can  make  timely,  informed  decisions  and  are          able  to  evaluate  the  stewardship  of  management  body  and  senior  management.    	1
79. Financial and credit risk management disclosures should be made in accordance with the     applicable accounting and supervisory frameworks 26. Credit institutions	should  provide  the          disclosures  needed  to  fairly  depict  a  credit  institutions’s  exposure  to  credit  risk,  including  its          ECL  estimates,  and  to  provide  relevant  information  on  a  credit  institution’s  underwriting          practices.      	1
80. Consistently with the applicable accounting standards and regulations, credit institutions’     senior management should apply judgement to determine the appropriate level of	        aggregation  and  disaggregation  of  data  disclosed,  such  that  disclosures  continue  to  meet          accounting  requirements,  and  provide  insights  into  a  credit  institution’s  exposure  to  credit          risk  and  ECLs  for  users  to  perform  individual  institution  analysis  and  relevant  peer  group          comparisons.        	1
81. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures when taken as a whole should communicate to users     the main assumptions/inputs used to develop ECL estimates.	Disclosures  should  highlight          policies  and  definitions  that  are  integral  to  the  estimation  of  ECL  (such  as  a  credit  institution’s          basis  for  grouping  lending  exposures  into  portfolios  with  similar  credit  risk  characteristics  and          its  definition  of  default  27),  factors  that  cause  changes  in  ECL  estimates,  and  the  manner  in          which  senior  management’s  experienced  credit  judgement  has  been  incorporated.  Disclosure          of  significant  policies  should  indicate  how  those  policies  have  been  implemented  in  the          specific  context  of  the  credit  institution.              	1
82. Credit institutions should provide qualitative disclosures on how forward-looking information,     including macroeconomic factors, has been incorporated into the ECL estimation process,	in          accordance  with  the  applicable  accounting  framework,  in  particular  when  the  assessment  is          carried  out  on  an  individual  basis.        	1
83. Disclosures regarding the basis for grouping lending exposures should include information on     how senior management satisfies itself that lending exposures are	appropriately  grouped,          such  that  these  groups  continue  to  share  credit  risk  characteristics.  	1
84. To improve the quality and meaningfulness of information disclosed for ECL estimates, credit     institutions should provide an explanation of significant changes	to  the  estimation  of  ECL  from        	1
26   In accordance with Part 8 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, EBA GL/2016/11 on disclosures requirements under Part 8 of Regulation (EU) 573/2013) and EBA	GL/2014/14  on  materiality,  proprietary  and  confidentiality  and  on  disclosure  frequency  under  Articles  432(1),  432(2)  and  433  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013.  27    See  paragraphs  89  and  90  in  the  next  section  for  further  guidance  on  definition  of  default.            	1
85. Credit institutions’ management body should regularly review its disclosure policies to ensure     that the information disclosed continues to be relevant to	the  credit  institution’s  risk  profile,          product  concentrations,  industry  norms  and  current  market  conditions.  In  doing  so,  credit          institutions  should  provide  disclosures  that  facilitate  comparisons  with  its  peers,  enabling          users  to  monitor  changes  in  the  credit  institution’s  ECL  estimates  from  period  to  period  and          perform  meaningful  analyses  across  national  and  international  peer  groups.          	1
4.3 Guidelines specific to credit institutions applying IFRS 9 This section provides guidelines on aspects of the ECL requirements in the impairment sections of IFRS 9	—  (i)  the  loss  allowance  at  an  amount  equal  to  12-month  ECL;  (ii)  the  assessment  of  significant  increases  in  credit  risk;  and  (iii)  the  use  of  practical  expedients  —  that  are  not  common  to  other  ECL  accounting  frameworks  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  other  sections  of  these  guidelines.  	1
86. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of IFRS 9 ’if, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a     financial instrument has	not  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition,  an  entity  shall          measure  the  loss  allowance  for  that  financial  instrument  at  an  amount  equal  to  12-month          expected  credit  losses’.  Credit  institutions  should  measure  ECL  for  all  lending  exposures  and  a          nil  allowance  should  be  rare  because  ECL  estimates  are  a  probability-weighted  amount  that          should  always  reflect  the  possibility  that  a  credit  loss  will  occur  (see  paragraphs  5.5.17  and            	1
87. Credit institutions should adopt an active approach to assessing and measuring 12-month ECL     that enables changes in credit risk to be	identified  in  a  timely  manner  and  hence  the  timely          recognition  of  those  changes  in  ECL.  In  accordance  with  Principle  6  estimates  of  the  amount          and  timing  of  12-month  ECL  should  reflect  senior  management’s  experienced  credit          judgement,  and  represent  an  unbiased  probability-weighted  estimate  of  ECL  by  considering  a          range  of  possible  outcomes            	1
88. IFRS 9 defines an amount equal to 12-month ECL as ‘the portion of lifetime expected credit     losses that represent the expected	credit  losses  that  result  from  default  events  on  a  financial          instrument  that  are  possible  within  the  12  months  after  the  reporting  date’  28.  For  these          purposes,  credit  institutions  must  note  that  an  amount  equal  to  the  12-month  ECL  is  not  only          the  losses  expected  in  the  next  12  months;  rather,  in  accordance  with  IFRS  9            	1
89. IFRS 9 paragraph B5.5.37, does not define default, but requires credit institutions to define     default in a manner consistent with that	used  for  internal  credit  risk  management.  IFRS  9          paragraph  B5.5.37,  also  includes  a  rebuttable  presumption  that  default  does  not  occur  later          than  90  days  past  due.  When  adopting  a  definition  of  default  for  accounting  purposes,  credit          institutions  should  be  guided  by  the  definition  used  for  regulatory  purposes  provided  in          Article  178  of  Regulation  (EU)  575/2013  29  which  includes  both:          	1
90. In accordance with Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, a default event shall be     considered to have occurred with regard to	a  particular  obligor  when  either  of  the  criteria  in          paragraphs  4(a)  and  (b)  is  met,  or  both  are  met.  In  this  context,  credit  institutions  should          identify  default,  in  accordance  with  the  ’unlikeliness  to  pay’  criterion  of  the  debtor,  before  the          exposure  becomes  delinquent  with  the  90-days-past-due  criterion.  In  line  with  the  approach          followed  for  regulatory  purposes,  the  list  of  elements  provided  in  Article  178(3)  of  Regulation          (EU)  575/2013  as  indications  of  unlikeliness  to  pay  should  be  implemented  in  a  way  that          ensures  a  timely  detection  of  ‘unlikeliness  to  pay’  events  that  precipitate  eventual  cash          shortfalls.  As  regards  the  criterion  in  paragraph  4(b),  although  for  regulatory  purposes  in  the          case  of  retail  and  public  sector  entity  obligations,  for  the  90-day  figure  competent  authorities          may  substitute  a  figure  of  up  to  180  days  for  different  products,  as  it  considers  appropriate  to          local  conditions  (see  Article  178(1)(b)  of	1
91. In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should     consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred	to  in  the  Definitions  and  in          Principle  6  of  these  guidelines,  that  affect  credit  risk,  especially  forward-looking  information,          including  macroeconomic  factors.  Credit  institutions  should  exercise  experienced  credit          judgement  to  consider  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  information  that  may  affect  the          credit  institution’s  assessment  of  credit  risk.  IFRS  9  provides  that  an  entity  does  not  need  to          undertake  an  exhaustive  search  for  information  when  measuring  an  amount  equal  to  -12          month  ECL.  However,  credit  institutions  should  actively  incorporate  information  that  may          affect  the  estimate  of  ECL,  and  credit  institutions  should  not  exclude  or  ignore  relevant          information  that  is  reasonably  available.            	1
92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be     understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the	opposite  of  ‘low  credit  risk’          exposures  as  described  by  IFRS  9  paragraph  5.5.10)  and  their  allowances  are  initially          measured  at  12-month  ECL,  the  credit  institution  should  monitor  these  exposures  closely  for          significant  increases  in  credit  risk  to  ensure  a  timely  movement  of  the  exposure  to  lifetime          ECL  measurement,  in  order  to  take  into  account  that  high  risk  exposures  are  likely  to  exhibit          greater  volatility  and  to  experience  a  more  rapid  increase  in  credit  risk.              	1
93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should     adjust its estimate of	12-month  ECL  to  appropriately  reflect  changes  in  credit  risk  that  have          taken  place.  Such  adjustments  should  be  made  well  before  exposures  move,  either          individually  or  collectively,  to  lifetime  ECL  measurement  and  taking  into  account  any          migration  of  credit  risk  which  has  taken  place.        	1
94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to     the requirements set out in Principle 3 of	these  guidelines.  In  particular,  where  information          becomes  available  to  the  credit  institution  indicating  that  further  or  different  segmentation          within  a  group  of  lending  exposures  is  required,  the  group  should  be  split  into  subgroups  and          the  measurement  of  the  amount  equal  to  12-month  ECL  should  be  updated  separately  for          each  subgroup  or,  in  the  case  of  transient  circumstances,  a  temporary  adjustment  should  be          applied  (see  Principle  3  of  these  guidelines  and  its  detailed  requirements  on  the  use  of          temporary  adjustments).  Where  information  becomes  available  which  indicates  that  a          particular  subgroup  has  suffered  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk,  then  lifetime  ECL  should          be  recognised  in  respect  of  that  subgroup.      	1
95. Lending exposures should not be grouped in such a way as to obscure the identification of     significant increases in credit risk	on  a  timely  basis  (see  also  Principles  3  and  4  of  these          guidelines  for  additional  requirements  regarding  grouping  and  collective  assessments  of  ECL).        	1
96. IFRS 9 paragraph 5.5.4, states that ‘the objective of the impairment requirements is to     recognise lifetime expected credit losses for all	financial  instruments  for  which  there  have          been  significant  increases  in  credit  risk  since  initial  recognition  —  whether  assessed  on  an  38  FINAL  REPORT  ON  GUIDELINES  ON  CREDIT  INSTITUTIONS’  CREDIT  RISK  MANAGEMENT  PRACTICES  AND  ACCOUNTING  FOR  EXPECTED  CREDIT  LOSSES      	1
97. The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the     ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is	taken  into  account  in  the  pricing  of  credit  at  that          time.  It  follows,  then,  that  a  post-origination  increase  in  credit  risk  may  not  be  fully          compensated  by  the  interest  rate  charged,  and,  as  a  consequence,  credit  institutions  should          carefully  consider  whether  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  30.  If  so,  the          lending  exposure  should  be  subject  to  lifetime  ECL  measurement.  	1
98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and     the measurement of required 12-month	ECL  and  lifetime  ECL,  credit  institutions  should  have          in  place  sound  governance,  systems  and  controls,  in  accordance  with  the  principles  specified          in  these  guidelines.  Unless  already  established,  credit  institutions  should  implement  systems          that  are  capable  of  handling  and  systematically  assessing  the  large  amounts  of  information          that  will  be  required  to  judge  whether  or  not  particular  lending  exposures  or  groups  of          lending  exposures  exhibit  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk,  and  to  measure  lifetime  ECL          where  that  is  the  case.  Parent  undertakings  and  subsidiaries  subject  to  Directive  2013/36/EU          should  ensure  that  the  approach  is  consistent  across  the  group.  This  should  include,  in          particular,  putting  in  place  processes  to  ensure  that  forecasts  of  economic  conditions  in          different  jurisdictions  and  economic  sectors  are  reviewed  and  approved  by  a  credit          institution’s  senior  management,  and  that  the  process,  controls  and  economic  assumptions          around  developing  forecasts  and	1
99. Credit institutions’ processes in place should enable them to determine on a timely and     holistic basis whether there has been a	significant  increase  in  credit  risk  subsequent  to  the          initial  recognition  of  a  lending  exposure  so  that  an  individual  exposure,  or  a  group  of          exposures  with  similar  credit  risk  characteristics,  is  transferred  to  lifetime  ECL  measurement          as  soon  as  credit  risk  has  increased  significantly,  in  accordance  with  the  IFRS  9  impairment          accounting  requirements.          	1
100.   As noted in paragraph B5.5.17 of IFRS 9 on assessing significant increases in credit risk    since initial recognition, the range	of  information  that  will  need  to  be  considered  in  making        this  determination  is  wide.  In  broad  terms,  it  will  include  information  on  macroeconomic        conditions,  and  the  economic  sector  and  geographical  region  relevant  to  a  particular        borrower  or  a  group  of  borrowers  with  shared  credit  risk  characteristics,  in  addition  to        borrower-specific  strategic,  operational  and  other  characteristics.  A  critical  feature  is  the  	1
101.   In order to recognise allowances on a timely basis in line with the IFRS 9 requirements,  	  credit institutions should: 	1
102.   IFRS 9 paragraph B5.5.2, states that lifetime expected credit losses are generally    expected to be recognised before a financial instrument	becomes  past  due  and  that  ‘typically,        credit  risk  increases  significantly  before  a  financial  instrument  becomes  past  due  or  other        lagging  borrower-specific  factors  (for  example  a  modification  or  restructuring)  are  observed’.        Therefore,  credit  institutions’  analyses  should  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the        determinants  of  credit  losses  very  often  begin  to  deteriorate  a  considerable  time  (months  or,        in  some  cases,  years)  before  any  objective  evidence  of  delinquency  appears  in  the  lending        exposures  affected.  Credit  institutions  should  be  mindful  that  delinquency  data  are  generally        backward-looking,  and  will  seldom  on  their  own  be  appropriate  in  the  implementation  of  an        ECL  approach.  For  example,  within  retail  portfolios  adverse  developments  in  macroeconomic        factors  and  borrower  attributes  will  generally  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  level  of  credit  risk        long  before  this  manifests  itself  in  lagging  information  such  as  delinquency.              	1
103.   Thus, in order to meet the objective of IFRS 9 in a robust manner, credit institutions    should also consider the	linkages  between  macroeconomic  factors  and  borrower  attributes  to        the  level  of  credit  risk  in  a  portfolio  based  on  reasonable  and  supportable  information.  To  that        end,  credit  institutions  should  start  with  a  detailed  analysis  of  historical  patterns  and  current        trends,  which  would  allow  for  identification  of  the  most  relevant  credit  risk  drivers.        Experienced  credit  judgement  should  facilitate  the  incorporation  of  current  and  forecasted        conditions  likely  to  affect  those  risk  drivers,  the  expected  cash  shortfalls  and  therefore  loss        expectations.            	1
104.   Credit institutions should perform analyses of this kind not only in the context of    portfolios of individually small credits, such	as  credit  card  exposures,  but  also  for  large,        individually  managed  lending  exposures.  For  example,  for  a  large  commercial  property  loan,        credit  institutions  should  take  account  of  the  considerable  sensitivity  of  the  commercial        property  market  in  many  jurisdictions  to  the  general  macroeconomic  environment,  and        consider  using  information  such  as  levels  of  interest  rates  or  vacancy  rates  to  determine        whether  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk.          	1
105.    Credit institutions should have a clear policy including well-developed criteria on what    constitutes a ‘significant’ increase in credit risk	for  different  types  of  lending  exposures.  Such        criteria  and  the  reasons  why  these  approaches  and  definitions  are  considered  appropriate        should  be  disclosed  in  accordance  with  IFRS  7  Financial  Instruments:  Disclosures,        paragraph  35F.  IFRS  9  paragraph  5.5.9,  requires  that,  when  making  the  assessment  of        significant  increases  in  credit  risk,  ‘an  entity  shall  use  the  change  in  the  risk  of  default        occurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  instead  of  the  change  in  the        amount  of  expected  credit  losses’.  For  these  purposes,  institutions  should  make  this        assessment  in  terms  of  the  risk  of  a  default  occurring  and  not  expected  credit  loss  (i.e.  before        consideration  of  the  effects  of  credit  risk  mitigants  such  as  collateral  or  guarantees).      	1
106.    In developing their approach to determining a significant increase in credit risk, credit    institutions should consider each of the	16  classes  of  indicators  in  IFRS  9  (insofar  as  they  are        relevant  to  the  financial  instrument  being  assessed)  as  set  out  in  paragraphs  B5.5.17(a)-(p)        and,  in  addition,  credit  institutions  should  consider  whether  there  is  further  information  that        should  be  taken  into  account.  Such  indicators  (in  both  IFRS  9  and  these  guidelines)  should  not        be  viewed  as  a  ‘checklist’.  Some  may  be  more  relevant  than  others  to  assessing  whether  a        particular  type  of  lending  exposure  exhibits  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk.  At  the  same        time,  credit  institutions  should  take  particular  care  to  avoid  the  risk  of  a  significant  increase  in        credit  risk  not  being  acknowledged  promptly  when  it  is,  in  fact,  present.  In  particular,  credit        institutions  should  not  restrict  significant  increases  in  credit  risk  to  situations  when  a  financial        instrument  is  anticipated  to  become  credit  impaired  (i.e.  the  third  stage  of  IFRS  9  impairment        requirements).  Rather,  debtors  may  exhibit  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk	1
107.   Credit institutions should consider in particular the following non-exhaustive list of  	  indicators in assessing a significant increase in credit risk:	1
108.   When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for a lending    exposure, credit institutions should also	take  into  account  the  following  factors  which  are        related  to  the  environment  in  which  a  credit  institution  or  the  borrower  operates:              	1
109.    Accurate identification of drivers of credit risk, and reliable demonstration of the linkages    between those drivers and the level	of  credit  risk,  should  be  considered  as  critical,  as  a        seemingly  small  change  in  a  qualitative  characteristic  of  a  loan  can  potentially  be  a  leading        indicator  of  a  large  increase  in  the  risk  of  a  default  occurring.  Furthermore,  in  accordance  with        IFRS  9  paragraph  5.5.9,  the  significance  of  a  change  in  credit  risk  since  initial  recognition        depends  on  the  risk  of  a  default  occurring  at  initial  recognition.  In  this  regard,  where  a  credit        institution  uses  changes  in  PD  as  a  means  of  identifying  changes  in  the  risk  of  a  default        occurring,  it  should  take  into  consideration  the  significance  of  a  given  change  in  PD  expressed        in  a  ratio  (or  the  rate  of  fluctuation)  proportionate  to  the  PD  at  initial  recognition  (i.e.  a        change  in  the  PD  divided  by  the  PD  at  initial  recognition),  considering  also  paragraph  B5.5.11      	1
110.    Credit institutions should look beyond how many ‘grades’ a rating downgrade entails    because the change in PD for a	one-grade  movement  may  not  be  linear  (for  example,  the        default  probability  over  five  years  of  an  exposure  rated  BB  is  around  three  times  that  of  one        rated  BBB,  based  on  current  data  and  analyses  applicable  to  certain  jurisdictions).        Furthermore,  because  the  significance  of  a  one-grade  movement  would  depend  on  the        granularity  of  a  bank’s  rating  system  —  and  hence  the  ‘width’  of  each  grade  —  an  appropriate        initial  segmentation  should  be  defined  to  ensure  that  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  for  an        individual  lending  exposure  or  a  group  of  lending  exposures  is  not  obscured  within  a  segment.        In  this  regard,  credit  institutions  should  ensure  that  credit  risk  rating  systems  include  a        sufficient  number  of  grades  to  appropriately  distinguish  credit  risk.  Credit  institutions  should        also  be  mindful  of  the  fact  that  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  could  occur  prior  to  a        movement  in  a  credit  grade.  	1
111.   Credit institutions should take into account that there are some circumstances in which    an adverse movement in the factors listed	in  paragraphs  107  and  108  above  might  not  be        indicative  of  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk.  For  example,  it  may  be  the  case  that  the        default  probability  of  a  lending  exposure  rated  AA  is  low,  and  not  much  greater  than  one        rated  AAA.  However,  very  few  lending  exposures  are  of  such  apparently  low  credit  risk  —  and,        as  noted  in  paragraph  110  the  sensitivity  of  default  probability  to  rating  grades  may  increase        strongly  as  rating  quality  declines.  	1
112.   Credit institutions should also be aware that there could be circumstances in which some    factors move in an adverse direction	but  may  be  counterbalanced  by  improvement  in  others        (see  IFRS  9  Implementation  Guidance,  Example  2).  Nonetheless,  in  view  of  the  importance  of        detecting  whether  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk,  credit  institutions        should  put  in  place  governance  and  control  processes  capable  of  reliably  validating  any        judgement  that  factors  which  may  have  an  adverse  impact  on  credit  risk  are  counterbalanced        by  factors  which  may  have  a  favourable  impact.    	1
113.    Credit institutions should give thorough consideration and full weight to discretionary    decisions by a credit institution’s management body or	senior  management  which  point  to  a        change  in  credit  risk.  For  example,  if  because  of  concerns  about  credit  risk  a  decision  is  made        to  intensify  the  monitoring  of  a  borrower  or  class  of  borrowers,  it  is  unlikely  that  such  action        would  have  been  taken  by  the  decision-maker  had  the  increase  in  credit  risk  not  been        perceived  as  significant.      	1
114.    When a credit institution assesses that there has been a significant increase in credit risk    for some, but not	all,  of  its  lending  exposures  to  a  counterparty  —  for  example,  because  of        differences  in  the  timing  of  when  lending  was  provided  —  it  should  ensure  that  all  lending        exposures  are  identified  where  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk.        	1
115.   Where a credit institution makes the assessment of significant increases in credit risk on a    collective basis (i.e. such as	retail),  the  definitions  of  portfolios  should  be  reviewed  regularly        to  ensure  that  the  lending  exposures  within  them  continue  to  share  risk  characteristics  in        terms  of  their  response  to  credit  risk  drivers.  Changing  economic  conditions  may  require        regrouping.            	1
116.    In line with paragraph B5.5.1 of IFRS 9 on the assessment of significant increases in credit    risk since initial	recognition  on  a  collective  basis,  in  instances  where  it  is  apparent  that,  within        a  group  of  lending  exposures,  some  lending  exposures  have  experienced  a  significant  increase        in  credit  risk,  credit  institutions  should  transfer  a  subset  or  a  proportion  of  the  group  of        lending  exposures  to  lifetime  ECL  measurement  even  though  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  this        on  an  individual  lending  exposure  basis  (see  IFRS  9  Illustrative  Example  5).            	1
117.   Consistent with paragraph B5.5.6 of IFRS 9 and paragraph IE39 of the Implementation    Guidance for IFRS 9 if it is	not  possible  on  the  basis  of  shared  credit  risk  characteristics  to        identify  a  particular  subgroup  of  lending  exposures  for  which  credit  risk  has  increased        significantly,  an  appropriate  proportion  of  the  overall  group  should  be  subject  to  lifetime  ECL        measurement.        	1
118.   ‘Significant’ should not be equated with statistical significance, meaning that the    assessment approach should not be based solely on quantitative	analysis.  For  portfolios  which        have  a  large  number  of  individually  small  credits,  and  a  rich  set  of  relevant  historical  data,  it        may  be  possible  to  identify  ‘significant’  increases  in  credit  risk  in  part  by  using  statistical        techniques.  However,  for  other  lending  exposures,  that  may  not  be  feasible.      	1
119.    ‘Significant’ should also not be judged in terms of the extent of impact on a credit    institution’s primary financial	statements.  Identification  and  disclosure  of  significant  increases        in  credit  risk  should  be  undertaken,  even  where  an  increase  in  credit  risk  defined  in  terms  of        probability  of  default  is  unlikely  to  affect  the  allowance  made  —  for  example,  because  the        exposure  is  more  than  fully  collateralised  —  to  allow  credit  institutions  to  identify  and        disclose  such  increases  which  are  likely  to  be  important  to  users  seeking  to  understand  trends        in  the  intrinsic  credit  risk  of  a  credit  institution’s  lending  exposures.              	1
120.   In accordance with IFRS 9 paragraph 5.5.9, the assessment of significant increases in    credit risk is based on comparing credit	risk  on  exposures  at  the  reporting  date  relative  to        credit  risk  upon  initial  recognition.  IFRS  9  paragraph  BC  5161  and  Illustrative  Example  6        represent  an  example  of  the  application  of  this  principle  in  the  Standard,  rather  than  an        exception  to  that  principle.  This  example  suggests  that  credit  institutions  can  set  a  maximum        credit  risk  for  particular  portfolios  upon  initial  recognition  that  would  lead  to  that  portfolio        moving  to  lifetime  ECL  measurement  when  credit  risk  increases  beyond  that  maximum  level.        This  simplification  is  only  relevant  when  exposures  are  segmented  on  a  sufficiently  granular        basis  such  that  a  credit  institution  can  demonstrate  that  the  analysis  is  consistent  with  the        principles  of  IFRS  9.  Specifically,  credit  institutions  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  a          	1
121.   Credit institutions should rigorously review the quality of their approach to assessing    whether credit risk has increased significantly. A credit	institution’s  management  body  or        senior  management  should  consider  whether  there  are  additional  factors  that  should  be        taken  into  account  in  the  assessment  of  significant  increases  in  credit  risk  which  would        improve  the  quality  of  their  approach.              	1
122.   Credit institutions should be alert to any possibility of bias being introduced that would    prevent the objectives of IFRS 9	from  being  met.  In  cases  where  credit  institutions  believe        that  their  approach  to  implementation  is  likely  to  have  introduced  bias,  they  should  change        their  assessment  for  identified  bias  and  thus  ensure  that  the  objective  of  the  Standard  is  met        (see  in  particular  IFRS  9  paragraphs  B5.5.1-B5.5.6).        	1
123.   IFRS 9 in paragraphs 5.5.12 and B5.5.25-B5.5.27, sets out the requirements for the    assessment of significant increases in credit risk	for  lending  exposures  whose  contractual  cash        flows  have  been  renegotiated  or  modified.  In  particular,  for  modifications  that  do  not  result  in        derecognition  in  accordance  with  IFRS  9  an  entity  must  assess  whether  credit  risk  has        increased  significantly  by  comparing  (a)  the  risk  of  a  default  occurring  at  the  reporting  date        based  on  the  modified  contractual  terms  with  (b)  the  risk  of  default  occurring  upon  initial        recognition  based  on  the  original,  unmodified  contractual  terms.            	1
124.    Credit institutions should ensure that modifications or renegotiations do not obscure    increases in credit risk and thereby cause ECL	to  be  underestimated  and  to  delay  the  transfer        to  lifetime  ECL  for  obligors  whose  credit  risk  has  significantly  deteriorated,  or  inappropriately        result  in  a  move  from  lifetime  ECL  measurement  back  to  12-month  ECL  measurement.          	1
125.   When determining whether there is a significant increase in credit risk for a modified    lending exposure, credit institutions should be	able  to  demonstrate,  and  should  take  into        account  when  developing  ECL  estimates,  whether  such  modifications  or  renegotiations  have        improved  or  restored  the  ability  of  the  credit  institution  to  collect  interest  and  principal        payments  compared  with  the  situation  upon  initial  recognition.  Consideration  should  also  be        given  to  the  substance  of  modified  contractual  cash  flows  as  well  as  the  implications  of  the        modifications  for  the  future  credit  risk  of  the  lending  exposure  (taking  into  consideration  the        obligor’s  credit  risk).  Factors  to  consider  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  following:    	1
126.    Lending exposures transferred to lifetime ECL that are subsequently renegotiated or    modified, and not derecognised, should not move back	to  12-month  ECL  measurement  unless        there  is  sufficient  evidence  that  the  credit  risk  over  the  life  of  the  exposure  has  not  increased        significantly  compared  with  that  upon  initial  recognition.  For  example,  where  a  credit        institution  grants  various  concessions  such  as  interest  rate  reductions  or  postponements  of        principal  repayments  to  obligors  in  financial  difficulty,  the  lending  exposure  may  exhibit        characteristics  of  a  lower  credit  risk  even  though  in  reality  the  obligor  may  continue  to        experience  financial  difficulty  with  no  realistic  prospects  of  making  scheduled  repayments        over  the  remaining  term  of  the  exposure.  In  accordance  with  paragraph  B5.5.27  of  IFRS  9        ‘evidence  that  the  criteria  for  the  recognition  of  lifetime  ECL  are  no  longer  met  could  include        a  history  of  up-to-date  and  timely  payment  performance  against  the  modified  contractual        terms.  Typically,  a  customer  would  need  to  demonstrate  consistently  good  payment        behaviour  over  a  period  of  time  before  the  credit  risk  is  considered  to  have	1
127.   IFRS 9 includes a number of practical expedients, intended to ease the implementation    burden for a wide range of companies	in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  IFRS  9  will  be  used  by  a        variety  of  entities,  including  entities  outside  the  banking  industry.            	1
128.  The paragraphs below address the following practical expedients: the information set    which an entity must consider in measuring ECL; the exception	for  ‘low’  credit  risk  exposures;        and  the  30-days-past-due  rebuttable  presumption.        	1
129.    Credit institutions should make limited use of those practical expedients as they have the    potential to introduce significant bias	and  because  —  given  their  business  —  the  cost  of        obtaining  the  relevant  information  is  not  likely  to  involve  ‘undue  cost  or  effort’.  Credit        institutions  should  consider  the  need  to  make  adjustments  when  using  practical  expedients  to        avoid  any  resulting  bias,  as  they  should  take  into  account  that  the  objective  of  IFRS  9  is  to        estimate  expected  credit  losses  to  reflect  an  unbiased  and  probability-weighted  amount  that        is  determined  by  evaluating  a  range  of  possible  outcomes  (IFRS  9  paragraph  5.5.17).            	1
130.   Where a credit institution uses such practical expedients, justifications for the use of    practical expedients should be clearly documented by	the  credit  institution.              	1
131.    IFRS 9 paragraph B5.5.15, states that ´an entity shall consider reasonable and    supportable information that is available without undue	cost  and  effort´  and  that  ‘an  entity        need  not  undertake  an  exhaustive  search  for  information  when  determining  whether  credit        risk  has  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition’.  Credit  institutions  should  not  read        these  statements  restrictively  and  should  develop  systems  and  processes  that  use  all        reasonable  and  supportable  information  that  is  relevant  to  the  group  of  exposures  or        individual  exposure,  as  needed  to  achieve  a  high-quality,  robust  and  consistent        implementation  of  the  accounting  requirements.  Nevertheless,  additional  cost  and        operational  burden  do  not  need  to  be  introduced  where  they  do  not  contribute  to  a  highquality  implementation  of  IFRS  9.          	1
132.    In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9 ´an entity may assume that the credit risk    on a financial	instrument  has  not  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition  if  the  financial        instrument  is  determined  to  have  a  low  credit  risk  at  the  reporting  date´.  Although  credit        institutions  thus  have  the  option  for  ‘low  credit  risk’  exposures  not  to  assess  whether  credit        risk  has  increased  significantly  since  initial  recognition,  use  of  this  exemption  should  be        limited.  In  particular,  credit  institutions  should  conduct  timely  assessment  of  significant        increases  in  credit  risk  for  all  lending  exposures.            	1
133.   In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL    through the allowance where there is not a	significant  increase  in  credit  risk  and  move  lending        exposures  to  lifetime  ECL  measurement,  if  there  is  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk.  In  order        to  achieve  a  high-quality  implementation  of  IFRS  9  any  use  of  the  low-credit-risk  exemption        should  be  accompanied  by  clear  evidence  that  credit  risk  as  of  the  reporting  date  is        sufficiently  low  that  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial  recognition  could  not  have        occurred.      	1
134.    To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9 paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9    paragraph B5.5.23, cites as	an  example  an  instrument  with  an  external  ‘investment  grade’        rating.  However,  all  lending  exposures  that  have  an  ‘investment  grade’  rating  from  a  credit        rating  agency  cannot  automatically  be  considered  low  credit  risk.  Credit  institutions  should        rely  primarily  on  their  own  credit  risk  assessments  in  order  to  evaluate  the  credit  risk  of  a        lending  exposure,  and  not  rely  solely  or  mechanistically  on  ratings  provided  by  credit  rating        agencies  (where  the  latter  are  available).  Nevertheless,  optimistic  internal  credit  ratings,  as        compared  with  external  ratings,  should  require  additional  analysis  and  justification  by  a  credit        institution’s  management  body  or  senior  management.        	1
135.   Credit institutions should have credit risk assessment and management processes in place    to ensure that significant credit risk increases are	detected  well  ahead  of  exposures  becoming        	1
     past due or delinquent. Although the use of the more-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable      presumption as a backstop measure	is  not  precluded  in  accordance  with  IFRS  9  alongside            other,  earlier  indicators  for  assessing  significant  increase  in  credit  risk,  credit  institutions            should  avoid  using  it  as  a  primary  indicator  of  transfer  to  lifetime  ECL.  	1
136.   Any assertion that the more-than-30-days-past-due presumption is rebutted on the basis    that there has not been a significant increase in	credit  risk  should  be  accompanied  by  a        thorough  analysis  clearly  demonstrating  that  30  days  past  due  is  not  correlated  with  a        significant  increase  in  credit  risk  32.  Such  analysis  should  consider  both  current  and  reasonable        and  supportable  forward-looking  information  that  may  cause  future  cash  shortfalls  to  differ        from  historical  experience.        	1
137.   In this regard, credit institutions should use relevant forward-looking information that is    reasonable and supportable to analyse whether there is	any  substantive  relationship  between        such  information  and  credit  risk  drivers.  Credit  institutions  should  not  use  the  30-days-pastdue  rebuttable  presumption  unless  they  have  demonstrated  that  the  forward-looking        information  had  no  substantive  relationship  with  the  credit  risk  driver  or  such  information  is        not  available  without  undue  cost  or  effort.      	1
138.   In the limited instances where past-due information is the best criterion available to a    credit institution to determine when exposures	should  move  to  the  lifetime  ECL  category,        credit  institutions  should  pay  particular  attention  to  their  measurement  of  12-month  ECL        allowance  to  ensure  that  ECL  are  appropriately  captured  in  accordance  with  the        measurement  objective  of  IFRS  9.  Moreover,  credit  institutions  should  take  into  account  that        significant  reliance  on  backward-looking  information  will  introduce  bias  into  the        implementation  of  an  ECL  accounting  model  and  that  they  should  ensure  that  the  objectives        of  the  IFRS  9  impairment  requirements  (i.e.  to  reflect  ECL  that  meet  the  stated  measurement        objectives  and  to  capture  all  significant  increases  in  credit  risk)  are  met.            	1
139.   Competent authorities should be satisfied that credit institutions have adopted and    adhered to the sound credit risk practices described in	these  guidelines.  Competent        authorities’  evaluation  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  whether:  	1
140.    In making these evaluations, competent authorities may require credit institutions to    provide supplemental information, not publicly disclosed, through regular	supervisory        reporting,  ad  hoc  reporting  or  on-site  examinations.  Competent  authorities  could  also  use        these  approaches  for  obtaining  supplemental  information  when  performing  the  evaluations        called  for  in  the  principles  below.              	1
141.   In assessing the methods employed by a credit institution to estimate allowances,    competent authorities should be satisfied that the credit	institution  is  following  policies  and        practices  consistent  with  the  ECL  measurement  principles  outlined  in  these  guidelines,        including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  following:    	1
a. the procedures used by a credit institution to measure ECL are robust and timely and take    into account criteria such as updated	valuations  of  credit  risk  mitigants  (and,  in  particular,        collateral,  the  residual  risk  after  taking  into  account  the  mitigants,  the  correlation  of  that  risk        with  borrowers’  creditworthiness  and  the  potential  impact  in  terms  of  the  effectiveness  of        protection),  cash  flow  estimates  based  on  assessments  of  borrower-specific  factors  and        current  and  future  macroeconomic  conditions,  together  with  other  relevant  forward-looking        information  that  affects  the  expected  collectability  of  the  credit  institution’s  lending        exposure;              	1
142.   Competent authorities should scrutinise the use of practical expedients referred to in    section 4.3 to determine the appropriateness of ECL	measurement.    	1
143.   Competent authorities may make use of the work performed by internal and external    auditors in reviewing a credit institution’s credit	risk  assessment  and  ECL  measurement        functions  33.              	1
144.   In assessing the appropriateness of the level of allowances for lending exposures as an    element of a credit institution’s overall	capital  adequacy,  competent  authorities  should  look        at  their  credit  risk  practices  and  take  into  account  that  the  credit  institution’s  related  ECL        processes,  methodology  and  underlying  assumptions  require  the  exercise  of  a  substantial        degree  of  experienced  credit  judgement.            	1
145.    In performing their assessments, competent authorities should consider whe	ther a credit    institution has:      	1
146.    When assessing capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider how a credit    institution’s accounting and credit risk assessment policies and	practices  affect  the        measurement  of  the  credit  institution’s  assets  and  earnings  and,  therefore,  its  capital        position.    	1
147.    Where competent authorities identify deficiencies when assessing a credit institution’s    credit risk practices, they should consider how these deficiencies	affect  the  level  of  reported        allowances  and,  if  the  aggregate  amount  of  allowances  is  not  appropriate  under  the        applicable  accounting  framework,  the  competent  authority  should  discuss  this  with  the  credit        institution’s  senior  management  and  management  body  and  take  further  appropriate        supervisory  action  when  necessary.      	1
148.   In particular, to the extent that credit risk assessment or ECL measurement deficiencies    are significant or are not remedied on	a  timely  basis,  competent  authorities  should  consider      	1
1.1.   Competent authorities should ensure that at least two different channels are available for  complainants to submit	their  complaints  of  alleged  infringement  of  Directive  (EU)  2015/2366  and  that  at  least  one  of  these  channels  is  easily  accessible  for  all  types  of  complainants.            	1
1.2.   Competent authorities should ensure that at least one of the channels referred to in  Guideline 1.1.	is  digital  and  accessible  online,  such  as  an  email  or  a  web  form.        	1
2.1.   Competent authorities should request from complainants to provide, where possible,  information which includes but is not	limited  to:  	1
2.2.   Competent authorities should record the information provided by t	he complainants under  Guideline 2.1.   	1
2.3.   Competent authorities should make means available for complainants to submit any  documentary evidence in support of	the  complaint,  such  as  a  copy  of  their  contract  with  the  payment  service  provider,  any  correspondence  exchanged  with  the  payment  service  provider(s)  or  with  any  other  entity,  and  information  related  to  their  payment  account  if  relevant.    	1
3.1.   When responding to the complainants and, where appropriate, informing them of the  existence of alternative dispute	resolution  procedures  in  accordance  with  Article  99(2)  of  Directive  (EU)  2015/2366,  competent  authorities  should  also  provide:  	1
3.2.   Competent authorities should send the reply to the complainant   	 without undue delay.  	1
3.3.   Competent authorities should include information as set out in Guideline 3.1.d. in any  subsequent communication that	they  may  have  with  the  complainant.        	1
4.1.   Taking into account at least the information collected under Guideline 2.1., competent  authorities should have a	complaints  procedure  in  place  that  allows  for  the  aggregate  analysis  of  complaints  of  alleged  infringements  of  Directive  (EU)  2015/2366  and  enables  competent  authorities  to  identify,  understand  and  assess,  for  a  given  timeframe:            	1
4.2.   Competent authorities should take into account the aggregate analysis of complaints  referred to in Guideline 4.1.	to  ensure  and  monitor  effective  compliance  of  payment  service  providers  with  Directive  (EU)  2015/2366.      	1
4.3.   Competent authorities should treat complaints from the same complainant, about the  same payment service provider and	with  the  same  description  of  the  situation  that  gave  rise  to  the  complaint,  as  a  single  complaint  for  the  purposes  of  the  aggregate  analysis  of  complaints  referred  to  in  Guideline  4.1.              	1
5.1.   Competent authorities should document their complaints procedures by outlining the  procedure for the receipt of complaints	submitted  by  payment  service  users  and  other  interested  parties,  as  laid  down  in  these  Guidelines,  and  the  internal  governance  of  that  procedure.    	1
6.1.   Competent authorities should make publicly available information on their procedures for  complaints of alleged infringements of	Directive  (EU)  2015/2366.  This  information  should  be  up  to  date  and  easily  accessible,  and  include  but  not  be  limited  to:        	1
13. Institutions should comply with these guidelines in a manner proportionate to their size,     complexity and intensity of activity, taking account of	Table  3  in  Annex  B  and  the  provisions  of          Title  2.1.1  of  the  EBA  guidelines  on  common  procedures  and  methodologies  for  the  supervisory          review  and  evaluation  process  (SREP  guidelines).  2              	1
14. Institutions should demonstrate that their internal capital is commensurate with the level of     the interest rate risk in their banking book,	taking  into  account:              	1
15. When managing their IRRBB institutions should not rely on the calculations of the outcome of     the supervisory standard shock as set	out  in  Article  98(5)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  or  in  IRRBB  5          but  should  develop  and  use  their  own  internal  capital  allocation  methodologies  in  accordance          with  their  risk  profile  and  risk  management  policies.          	1
16. Institutions should measure their exposure to interest rate risk in the banking book, in terms of     both potential changes to economic	value  (EV),  and  changes  to  expected  net  interest  income          (NII)  or  earnings.  	1
17. When measuring their IRRBB institutions should not rely on the calculations of the outcome of     the supervisory standard shock as set	out  in  Article  98(5)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  or  in  IRRBB  5          but  should  develop  and  use  their  own  assumptions  and  calculation  methods.          	1
18. Institutions should routinely measure EV and NII/earnings sensitivity under different scenarios     for potential changes in the level and shape of the	interest  rate  yield  curve,  and  to  changes  in          the  relationship  between  different  market  rates  (i.e.  basis  risk).      	1
19. Institutions should also consider whether a purely static analysis of the impact of a given interest     rate shock or shocks on	their  current  portfolio  should  be  supplemented  by  a  more  dynamic          interest  rate  simulation  approach.  Larger  and/or  more  complex  institutions,  in  particular          institutions  under  categories  1  and  2  of  the  SREP  guidelines  3  should  also  take  into  account          scenarios  where  different  interest  rate  paths  are  computed  and  where  some  of  the  assumptions          (e.g.  relating  to  behaviour,  contribution  to  risk  and  balance  sheet  size  and  composition)  are          themselves  functions  of  changing  interest  rate  levels.    	1
20. Institutions should implement robust internal governance arrangements  	 with regard to IRRBB.      	1
21. Institutions should have well-reasoned, robust and documented policies to address all IRRBB  	   issues that are important to their individual circumstances. 	1
22. Without prejudice to the proportionality principle, such 	 issues should include:        	1
23. Institutions should report to the competent authority the change in economic value that     results from calculating the outcome of the standard	shock,  as  referred  to  in  Article  98(5)  of          Directive  2013/36/EU  and  in  these  guidelines.            	1
24. When calculating the outcome of the standard shock, institutions should appl	y in particular the     following:      	1
25. When computing the effect of the ‘standard shock’ on their economic value, institutions should     use one of the calculation methods set	out  under  the  Capital  at  Risk  /  Economic  Value  of  Equity          headings  in  Tables  1  (Annex  A)  and  Table  3  (Annex  B).  ‘Level  2-4’  institutions  (as  referred  to  in          Annex  B)  may  be  asked  by  supervisors  to  use  more  complex  calculation  methods,  incorporating          more  granular  data  and  changes  in  client  behaviour  under  stress  scenarios.              	1
26. Institutions should measure their exposure as a result of applying an appropriate range of     different interest rate scenarios, taking into account	of  the  nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  the          interest  rate  risk  arising  from  their  activities  as  well  as  their  risk  profiles.  When  selecting  the          scenarios  to  be  used,  institutions  should  consider:            	1
27. Institutions may supplement their analysis by 	introducing, for instance:    	1
28. In performing their scenario analysis, institutions should at a minimum	 be able to demonstrate     that:      	1
29. A scenario analysis for the internal measurement of IRRBB should be performed at least on a     quarterly basis, with the frequency	of  calculation  increased  in  times  of  higher  interest  rate          volatility,  or  when  measured  risk  levels  are  significant  in  the  context  of  the  institution’s  business.      	1
30. Institutions should regularly perform stress tests to measure their vulnerability under stressed     market conditions. Stress testing for interest rate risk should	be  integrated  into  each  institution's          overall  stress  testing  structures  and  programmes.  In  these  stress  tests,  interest  rate  risk  should          interact  with  other  risk  categories  and  second-round  effects  should  be  computed.  These  tests          	1
31. Institutions should not rely on the standardised 200-basis point parallel interest rate shock     performed for the competent authority (see IRRBB 5),	but  should  use  an  appropriate  range  of          different  stress  scenarios,  in  particular:  	1
32. Furthermore, stress tests s	hould consider:        	1
33. IRRBB should be included in institutions’ overall stress testing program. IRRBB should also be     considered as one of the potential drivers	in  the  institution's  overall  reverse  stress  testing          programmes.          	1
34. In assessing the implications of such optionality, institutions should be able to take accoun	t of     the potential:    	1
35. Institutions should have policies in place governing the setting of, and the regular assessment of,     the key assumptions for the treatment	of  on  and  off-balance-sheet  items  that  have  embedded          options  in  their  interest  rate  risk  framework.  This  means  that  institutions  should:              	1
36. In making behavioural assumptions about accounts without specific repricing dates for the   	  purposes of interest rate risk management, institutions should: 	1
37. If institutions decide to adopt a policy intended to stabilise earnings arising from the	ir own     equity, they should:   	1
38. In deciding the investment term assumptions for equity capital, institutions should avoid taking     income stabilisation positions that significantly reduce their capability	to  adjust  to  significant          changes  in  the  underlying  economic  and  business  environment.  	1
39. The investment term assumptions used to manage the risks to earnings and value sensitivity     arising from equity capital should be considered	as  part  of  the  normal  corporate  planning  cycle,          and  such  assumptions  should  not  be  altered  just  to  reflect  a  change  in  the  institution’s          expectations  for  the  path  of  future  interest  rates.  Any  use  of  derivative  or  asset  portfolios  to          achieve  the  desired  investment  profile  should  be  clearly  documented  and  recorded.        	1
40. If an institution prefers not to set explicit assumptions for the investment term of equity capital     (or sets assumptions that are	explicitly  short-term),  the  return  generated  on  assets  financed  by          such  capital  may  be  more  volatile.  The  institution  should  therefore  still  have  robust  systems  in          place  and  management  information  available  so  that  it  can  identify  the  implications  of  its  chosen          approach  for  the  volatility  of  both  earnings  and  economic  value.          	1
41. Institutions should not rely on a single measure of risk but should instead use a wide range of     quantitative tools and	models,  including  methods  taken  from  those  listed  in  Annex  A  (Table  1)  of          these  guidelines,  to  ensure  that  the  various  aspects  of  interest  rate  risk  are  captured  adequately.          The  number  and  the  complexity  of  different  quantitative  tools  and  models  used  by  an  institution          to  measure  interest  rate  risk  should  be  appropriate  for  nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  the          activities  of  the  institution.  The  limitations  of  each  quantitative  tool  and  model  used  should  be          fully  understood  by  the  institution,  and  these  limitations  should  be  taken  into  account  in  the          interest  rate  risk  management  process.  In  assessing  its  interest  rate  risk,  an  institution  should  be          aware  of  the  risks  that  may  arise  as  a  consequence  of  accounting  treatment  of  transactions  in          the  banking  book.      	1
43. Institutions should identify all different components of the interest rate risk in their banking     book. All material risk sub-components should be	measured.  Table  2  provides  examples  of          methods  that  may  be  used  to  identify  the  different  types  of  IRRBB.    	1
45. For the monitoring of IRRBB, an institution should use at least one earnings-based measure and     at least one economic value measure	of  interest  rate  risk,  but  more  sophisticated  business          models  should  consider  multiple  measures  that,  in  combination,  capture  all  the  material  interest          risk  types  in  the  banking  book.  The  application  of  simple  models  and  measures  is  acceptable  only          where  it  can  be  shown  that  these  are  sufficient  to  produce  a  prudent  estimate  of  risk.  	1
46. Examples of sophistication would include the use of more time bands or tenors, more granular     input data and dynamic modelling of	feedback  from  stress  scenario  assumptions  into          assumptions  about  future  business  volumes  and  pricing.              	1
47. Table 3 in Annex B contains a matrix giving examples of different sophistication levels	 for each     quantitative tool and measure. 	1
48. In accordance with IRRBB 5 institutions should not rely upon the ‘standard shock’ as the only     measure of their IRRBB. In	particular,  they  should  also  have  an  earnings  measure,  and  should          consider  whether  alternative  economic  value  measures  are  better  suited  to  their  business          model.              	1
49. Based on the overarching business strategy, the management body should approve the overall     IRRBB strategy of the institution, including the acceptable	level  for  IRRBB  and  IRRBB  mitigation          (see  also  Principle  17  of  EBA  GL  44  on  internal  governance).      	1
50. The institution’s tolerance for IRRBB should be expressed in terms of the acceptable short-term     and long-term impact of fluctuating interest rates	on  both  economic  value  and  earnings  and  be          reflected  in  appropriate  limits.  Institutions  with  significant  exposures  to  basis  risk,  yield  curve  risk          or  positions  with  explicit  or  embedded  options  should  define  their  risk  tolerance  in  relation  to          each  of  these  material  sub-types  of  IRRBB.      	1
51. The overall IRRBB strategy should also include the decision about the extent to which the     business model should rely on generating	earnings  by  ‘riding  the  yield  curve’,  i.e.  funding  assets          with  a  comparatively  long  repricing  period  from  liabilities  with  a  comparatively  short  repricing          period.  Where  the  business  model  relies  heavily  on  this  source  of  earnings,  the  management          body  should  explain  its  IRRBB  strategy  and  how  it  plans  to  survive  periods  of  flat  or  inverse  yield          curves.    	1
52. Institutions should treat IRRBB as a material risk and assess it explicitly and comprehensively in     their risk management processes. Any other	approach  should  be  fully  documented  and  justified          in  the  course  of  supervisory  dialogue.              	1
53. Limit controls should be in place to ensure positions that exceed certain predetermined levels	     trigger prompt management reaction.   	1
54. Institutions using derivative instruments to mitigate IRRBB exposures should possess the     necessary knowledge and expertise. Each institution should demonstrate that it	understands  the          consequences  of  hedging  with  interest  rate  derivatives.        	1
55. When making decisions on hedging activities, institutions should be aware of the effects of     accounting policies, but the accounting treatment should	not  drive  their  risk  management          approach.  The  management  of  economic  risks  should  be  a  priority,  and  the  accounting  impacts          managed  as  a  secondary  concern.            	1
56. In relation to IRRBB, the management body should, based on its overall IRRBB strategy,     implement robust risk policies, processes and systems	which  should  ensure  that:            	1
57. Institutions should regularly validate their IRRBB models and IT systems. This validation should     be performed by a suitably qualified and independent	individual.    	1
58. Institutions may rely on third-party IRRBB models to manage and control IRRBB, provided that     these models are adequately customised to properly	reflect  the  specific  characteristics  of  the          institution  in  question.  Institutions  are  expected  to  fully  understand  the  underlying  analytics,          assumptions  and  methodologies  of  the  third-party  models  and  to  ensure  that  they  are          adequately  integrated  into  the  institutions’  overall  risk  management  systems  and  processes.          	1
59. The IT systems and applications used by the institution to carry out, process and record     operations as well as to generate	reports  should  be  capable  of  supporting  the  management  of          IRRBB.  In  particular,  the  systems  should:          	1
60. The IT system/transaction system should be capable of recording the repricing profile, interest     rate characteristics (including spread) and option characteristics of	the  products  to  enable          measurement  of  repricing  as  well  as  yield  curve,  basis  risk  and  option  risk.  In  particular,  the          transaction  system  should  especially  be  able  to  gather  detailed  information  on  the  repricing          date(s)  of  a  given  transaction,  interest  rate  type  or  index,  any  options  (including  early  repayment          or  redemption)  and  the  fees  relating  to  the  exercise  of  these  options.        	1
61. The systems used to measure the IRRBB should be capable of capturing the IRRBB characteristics     of all products. The systems should	also  allow  the  disaggregation  of  the  impact  of  individual          IRRBB  instruments/portfolios  at  the  risk  level  of  the  banking  book.  	1
62. For complex, structured products in particular, the transaction system should be able to gather     information about the separate parts of the	product  and  to  capture  their  IRRBB  characteristics          (e.g.  the  characteristics  of  assets  and  liabilities  grouped  by  certain  characteristics  like  repricing          dates  or  optionality  elements).  The  institution  should  ensure  that  the  IT  system  is  able  to  keep  up          with  the  introduction  of  new  products.        	1
63. Adequate organisational controls of IT systems should be in place to prevent the corruption of     data used by IRRBB computer systems	and  applications,  and  to  control  changes  to  the  coding          used  in  those  applications,  so  as  to  ensure,  in  particular:  	1
64. Risk measures should be based on reliable market and internal data. Institutions should     scrutinize the quality of external sources of information	used  to  establish  the  historical  databases          of  interest  rates,  as  well  as  the  frequency  at  which  databases  are  updated.  To  ensure  the  high          quality  of  data,  institutions  should  implement  appropriate  processes  that  ensure  that  the  data          entered  into  IT  system  is  correct.  Institutions  should  also  establish  appropriate  mechanisms  to          verify  the  correctness  of  the  aggregation  process  and  the  reliability  of  model  results.  These          mechanisms  should  confirm  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  data.    	1
65. The institution should have appropriate procedures to handle any discrepancies and     irregularities that arise at the time of data processing. The	institution  should  determine  the          reasons  for  these  and  should  have  procedures  in  place  for  the  mutual  reconciliation  of  the          positions  to  enable  these  discrepancies  and  irregularities  to  be  eliminated.  	1
66. The institution should set up an appropriate process to ensure that the data used to feed models     measuring the IRRBB across	the  group,  e.g.  for  simulating  earnings,  is  consistent  with  the  data          used  for  corporate  planning.          	1
67. The frequency of internal reports should increase with the complexity of the institution’s     operations, with quarterly reports being the minimum frequency	for  institutions  with  less          complex  portfolios.  Similarly,  the  content  of  the  reports  should  reflect  changes  in  the  risk  profile          of  the  institution  and  in  the  economic  environment.      	1
68. Internal reports should be provided to the different levels of management, and should contain     an appropriate level of information for the	particular  level  (e.g.  management  body,  senior          management)  and  for  the  specific  situation  of  the  institution  and  the  economic  environment.  	1
69. Aggregated information should provide sufficient detail to enable the management to assess the     sensitivity of the institution to changes in market	conditions  and  other  important  risk  factors.          These  reports  should  contain  information  on  exposures  to  repricing,  basis,  yield  curve  and          optionality  risk  as  well  as  information  on  the  types  and  results  of  stress  tests  performed,          including  the  standard  shocks  prescribed  by  the  competent  authority.        	1
70. The risk measurement system should generate reports in a format that allows the different levels     of the institution’s management to understand	the  reports  easily  and  to  make  appropriate          decisions  in  a  timely  manner.  The  reports  should  constitute  the  basis  for  regular  monitoring  of          whether  the  institution  operates  in  line  with  its  strategy  and  the  interest  rate  risk  limits  it  has          adopted.              	1
71. In their ICAAP analysis of the amount of capital required for IRRBB, institutions 	may consider     differentiating between:    	1
    (a) current internal capital held for risks to economic value that could arise from a sudden      	    interest  rate  shock;  and        	1
    (b) future internal capital requirements arising from the impact of rate changes on future  	earnings  capacity,  and  the  resultant  implications  for  internal  capital  buffer  levels.            	1
72. Where an institution’s policies/limits permit the taking of interest rate risk positions within the     banking book, these risks should be measured	and  monitored  like  any  other  market  risk.  Internal          capital  should  be  specifically  allocated  to  reflect  these  risks,  the  quantum  of  which  may  be          gauged  by  considering  other  capital  requirements  for  market  risk.  Institutions  should  regularly          consider  whether  any  positions  held  should  be  characterised  as  ‘trading’  and  thereby  treated          accordingly  for  capital  adequacy  purposes.        	1
73. In addition to considering whether internal capital should be held for actual IRRBB economic 	    value risk, institutions should also consider: 	1
74. To calibrate the amount of internal capital to be held for IRRBB economic value risk, institutions     should use appropriate economic value	measurement  systems  for  their  business  profile  (see  2.3          on  methods  for  measuring  interest  rate  risk)  and  an  appropriate  range  of  interest  rate  scenarios          (see  2.1  on  scenarios  and  stress  testing)  in  order  to  quantify  the  potential  scale  of  any  IRRBB          effects  under  stressed  conditions.      	1
75. In considering whether an allocation of internal capital should be made in respect of interest EaR     (as part of a capital	buffer  allocation  for  stress  testing),  institutions  should  take  into  account:              	1
76. To determine whether an amount of internal capital should be allocated for potential future risks     to earnings arising from changes to	interest  rate  risks  under  stressed  conditions,  institutions          should  use  appropriate  EaR  measurement  systems  for  their  business  profile  (see  2.3  on  methods          for  measuring  interest  rate  risk)  and  an  appropriate  range  of  interest  rate  scenarios  (see  2.1  on          scenarios  and  stress  testing).            	1
77. Institutions should consider internal capital buffer adjustments where the results of their stress     testing highlight the potential for reduced NII (and	therefore  reduced  capital  generation          capacity)  under  stress  scenarios.  To  the  extent  that  NII  has  been  protected/stabilised  against          adverse  movements  in  rates  through  risk  management  strategies  based  on  behavioural  and/or  	1
3.     Criteria to determine when competent authorities should conduct a comprehensive  review of SRT in	case  of  application  of  Article  243(2)  or  Article  244(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  575/2013        	1
1.   With regard to those securitisation transactions meeting the conditions for achieving SRT in      accordance with points (a) or	(b)  of  Article  243(2)  or  Article  244(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No            575/2013,  competent  authorities  should  conduct  a  comprehensive  review  of  SRT  in            accordance  with  Title  III,  paragraphs  4  to  10  of  these  Guidelines,  where  any  of  the  following            circumstances  contained  in  the  non-exhaustive  list  below  applies:          	1
1.   Competent authorities should assess the documentation and evidence provided by the      originator institution relating to the securitisation in	order  to  determine  whether            commensurate  credit  risk  has  been  transferred  to  third  parties  and  require  additional            information,  where  this  is  needed  to  conduct  the  assessment.  Competent  authorities  should            pay  particular  attention  to  amongst  others,  the  following  factors,  as  applicable:          	1
2.   Competent authorities should consider whether the originator institution has sufficient      knowledge of the underlying assets in order to	be  able  to  conduct  an  appropriate  credit  risk            transfer  analysis  and  should  also  consider  whether  there  is  idiosyncratic  risk  in  the  portfolio            which  is  not  captured  by  the  originator  institution’s  credit  risk  assessment  or  capital              	1
3.   In the case where the originator institution is relying on the supervisory formula to      determine its post-securitisation own	funds  requirements,  competent  authorities  should            consider  how  sensitive  the  own  funds  requirements  on  the  originator  institution’s  retained            securitisation  positions  are  to  changes  in  the  underlying  IRB  parameters.  If  the  capital            requirements  on  the  retained  securitisation  positions  are  highly  sensitive  to  small  changes  in            these  parameters,  it  is  less  likely  that  commensurate  credit  risk  has  been  transferred.        	1
1.   Competent authorities should assess if there are structural features in a transaction which      might undermine the claimed credit	risk  transfer  to  third  parties,  such  as  features  like            optional  calls  or  other  contractual  arrangements  which  in  case  of  traditional  securitisations            increase  the  likelihood  that  assets  will  be  brought  back  onto  the  originator  institution’s            balance  sheet  or  in  case  of  synthetic  securitisations  increase  the  likelihood  that  the  credit            protection  will  be  terminated  before  the  transaction’s  maturity.        	1
2.   For traditional securitisations, only the following call options granted to originator      institutions should not be considered detrimental to	achieving  effective  transfer  of  credit  risk            by  competent  authorities,  provided  these  call  options  do  not  grant  an  originator  institution            the  right  to  repurchase  from  the  transferee  the  previously  transferred  exposure  to  realise            their  benefits  or  oblige  the  originator  institution  to  re-assume  transferred  credit  risk:              	1
3.   Furthermore, and to avoid any uncertainty, for traditional securitisation, any option granted      to securitisation investors, with the exception	of  options  that  are  only  exercisable  in  the            event  of  contractual  breaches  by  the  originator  institution,  should  be  considered  by            competent  authorities  as  preventing  an  originator  from  achieving  effective  transfer  of  credit            risk.        	1
4.   For synthetic securitisations, any option granted to securitisation investors or credit      protection providers that is only exercisable in	the  event  of  contractual  breaches  by  other      	1
     parties involved in the transaction should not be considered by competent authorities as      preventing an originator	institution  from  achieving  effective  risk  transfer  of  credit  risk,            provided  the  requirements  of  Article  244(5)(c)  of  the  CRR  are  fulfilled.  All  other  options            granted  to  securitisation  investors  or  credit  protection  providers  should  be  assessed  by            competent  authorities,  as  they  may  result  in  additional  own  funds  requirements  due  to            maturity  mismatches.      	1
5.   Competent authorities should consider if the originator institution has in the past      repurchased transactions to protect investors and	if  the  rules  on  implicit  support  as  specified            in  Article  248  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  have  been  followed  by  the  originator            institution  to  ensure  that  risk  has  effectively  been  transferred.        	1
6.   Where transactions include replenishment periods, competent authorities should consider      the eligibility criteria of the assets in the underlying	pool  and  give  consideration  to  the            minimum  and  maximum  credit  quality  of  eligible  assets,  and  consider  if  the  assets  can  be            substituted  into  the  structure  with  the  view  to  protecting  investors  from  losses  while            increasing  credit  risk  to  the  originator  institution  to  ensure  that  risk  has  effectively  been            transferred.        	1
7.   Competent authorities should consider that transactions do not include any embedded      mechanism at origination that is reducing the	amount  of  credit  risk  transfer  by  the  originator            institution  to  third  parties  disproportionately  over  time.        	1
6.     Mismatches between credit protection and underlying assets for sy	nthetic  securitisations    	1
1.   Competent authorities should consider if there are maturity or currency mismatches      between the protection provided and the underlying	assets.  When  considering  the  maturity            of  the  protection,  competent  authorities  should  consider  whether  optional  calls  or  other            features  might  reduce  the  maturity  of  the  protection  in  practice,  and  how  this  relates  to  the            expected  time  of  defaults  on  the  asset  pool.      	1
2.   Competent authorities should assess maturity mismatches for transactions where asset pools      are able to replenish as originator institutions	may  substitute  in  longer  maturity  assets            towards  the  back-end  of  the  protection  period,  increasing  any  maturity  mismatch.    	1
3.   Competent authorities should assess currency mismatches for transactions where asset      pools contain a different currency profile to the	liabilities.  Where  such  mismatches  occur,            prudent  haircuts  should  be  applied  to  the  capital  relief  sought  in  accordance  with  the  views            of  the  competent  authorities.  Mitigating  instruments,  such  as  currency  swaps  should  be            assessed  for  appropriateness  in  terms  of  the  balance  swapped,  the  duration  of  the  swap            itself,  and  any  contingent  triggers.    	1
1.   Where the securitisation is achieved synthetically using a credit derivative or a guarantee,      competent authorities should ensure that	the  credit  protection  meets  all  the  relevant            requirements  set  forth  in  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and  provides  sufficient  certainty  of            payment  so  as  not  to  undermine  the  credit  risk  transfer.  If  the  credit  protection  is  funded,            the  collateral  arrangements  should  be  considered  including  that  they  meet  all  the  relevant            requirements  set  forth  by  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  for  funded  credit  protection.  If  the            credit  protection  is  unfunded,  competent  authorities  should  consider  whether  suitable            arrangements  are  in  place  to  ensure  timely  payment.        	1
2.   Competent authorities should consider the credit events that are covered by the credit      protection obtained (e.g. whether it	includes  standard  credit  events  like  bankruptcy,  failure            to  pay  or  restructuring  of  loans).            	1
3.   If premia paid to credit protection provides are not recognised in the profit and loss account      of the	originator  institution,  competent  authorities  should  consider  whether  premia  paid  to            credit  protection  providers  are  excessively  high  to  the  extent  that  SRT  will  be  undermined.            This  could  be  assessed  in  a  number  of  ways  such  as  by  looking  at  the  premia  paid  compared            to  (i)  the  yield  of  the  asset  pool,  or  (ii)  the  losses  being  covered  by  the  protection,  or  (iii)  fair            market  rates,  or  (iv)  some  combination  of  these  various  factors.  Competent  authorities            should  also  consider  whether  there  are  other  features  of  the  transaction  outside  of  premia,            such  as  fees,  which  effectively  increase  the  cost  of  the  protection  being  provided  to  the            extent  that  credit  risk  transfer  will  be  undermined.        	1
4.   Where premia are paid up-front, or not linked to losses in the asset pool being protected or      otherwise	guaranteed,  competent  authorities  should  consider  if  this  reduces  the  extent  of            credit  risk  transfer.          	1
1.   Competent authorities should assess whether significant credit risk is transferred to third      parties who are not connected to	the  originator  institution  in  a  manner  that  might            undermine  the  credit  risk  transfer.  Competent  authorities  should  consider  any  relevant            connection  between  the  investors  or  credit  protection  providers  and  the  originator            institution,  and  whether  the  originator  institution  provides  the  third  parties  with  significant            financing  when  conducting  their  SRT  assessment.          	1
1.   Where an originator institution is using the Ratings Based Method as specified in Article 261      of Regulation (EU)	No  575/2013  to  calculate  the  own  funds  requirements  for  its  exposures  to            a  securitisation,  competent  authorities  should  consider  whether  the  chosen  credit  rating      	1
1.    Competent authorities should consider whether the originator institution has appropriate       internal policies for making its own	assessment  of  credit  risk  transfer  and  SRT.  This  should              include  not  only  an  initial  assessment  of  the  transaction  when  the  originator  institution  is              first  seeking  the  exclusion  of  securitised  exposures  from  the  calculation  of  risk-weighted              exposure  amounts  and,  as  relevant,  expected  loss  amounts,  but  should  also  consider  the              ongoing  assessment  of  SRT  during  the  life  of  the  transaction.          	1
1.    Originator institutions should provide the competent authority with all requested       information of the securitisations on which	they  intend  to  demonstrate  SRT,  so  that              competent  authorities  can  conduct  the  assessment  of  SRT  to  third  parties  as  specified  in  Title              I  to  Title  III  of  these  Guidelines.        	1
2.    Originator institutions should at least notify the relevant competent authority of any       securitisation on which they	intend  to  demonstrate  SRT  which  is  not  similar  in  structure  and              portfolio  composition  to  previous  transactions  notified  by  the  institution.          	1
1.    Originator institutions should have a governance process in place for evaluating transactions       claiming SRT. This process	should  include  details  of  relevant  committees,  any  internal              approval  procedure,  and  evidence  of  appropriate  stakeholder  involvement  and  a  suitable,              auditable  trail  of  documentation.      	1
2.    Originator institutions should have appropriate systems and controls regarding SRT through       securitisation, including for the ongoing	monitoring  of  SRT  requirements,  at  least  on  a              quarterly  basis,  throughout  the  maturity  of  relevant  transactions.    	1
3.    Originator institutions should have policies and methodologies in place that ensure ongoing       compliance with all SRT	requirements  according  to  Articles  243  and  244  of  Regulation  (EU)              No  575/2013.            	1
1.    Originator institutions should have policies and methodologies in place that ensure the       possible reduction of own	funds  requirements  achieved  by  originator  institutions  through              securitisation  is  justified  by  a  commensurate  credit  risk  transfer  to  third  parties.            	1
2.    Originator institutions’ SRT policies should be part of their broader capital allocation       strategies. In particular, the	originator  institutions’  policies  on  transfer  of  credit  risk  and  SRT              to  third  parties  should  specify  how  transactions  claiming  SRT  align  with  originator              institutions’  overall  risk  management  strategies  and  internal  capital  allocation.    	1
3.    Originator institutions should make an assessment of the risks involved on any potential       transaction claiming SRT,	including  an  assessment  of  the  risk  of  the  underlying  assets,  an              assessment  of  the  securitisation  structure  itself  considering  the  credit  risk  of  the  tranches              and  other  relevant  factors  that  affect  the  substance  of  credit  risk  transfer.        	1
4.    When conducting their SRT assessment, originator institutions should also consider whether       the possible reduction of own	funds  requirements  is  in  line  with  the  economic  credit  risk              transfer  achieved,  for  example  by  comparing  the  effects  of  the  securitisation  on  originator              institutions’  economic  capital  and  on  originator  institutions’  own  funds  requirements.              	1
1.    Originator institutions should use appropriate methods and procedures 	to assess and       demonstrate SRT.   	1
2.    Originator institutions should assess the expected loss (EL) and the unexpected loss (UL) of       the securitised	assets  throughout  the  maturity  of  the  transaction  when  conducting  an  SRT              assessment.            	1
3.    Originator institutions should consider the transaction structure and structural features of       the securitisation, for example, if	the  transaction  is  cash  or  synthetic,  any  hedging  techniques              or  maturity  mismatches,  if  any.        	1
4.    In order to identify such factors that may undermine the transfer of credit risk and SRT to     	  third  parties,  originator  institutions  should  evaluate  the  degree  of  credit  risk  mitigation  or              credit  risk  transfer  of  a  transaction  considering,  amongst  others,  factors  such  as  the              following,  to  the  extent  applicable:  	1
Title V- Final Provisions and Implementation National competent authorities should implement these Guidelines by incorporating them in their supervisory procedures within six months of adoption. Thereafter,	national  competent  authorities  should  ensure  that  institutions  fully  comply  with  these  Guidelines  for  all  transactions  entered  into  after  the  adoption  of  these  Guidelines.  	1
9. The framework of recovery plan indicators should be established by institutions and assessed    by the competent authority taking into consideration the criteria	laid  down  in  the  following        paragraphs.  	1
10.Institutions should include recovery plan indicators of both a quantitativ	e and qualitative    nature.    	1
11.Institutions should include in the recovery plan at least the following mandatory categories of    recovery plan indicators which are explained in Titles III	to  VI  of  these  Guidelines:          	1
12.Additionally, institutions should include in the recovery plan the two following categories of    recovery plan indicators which are explained in Titles VII and	VIII  of  these  Guidelines,  unless        they  provide  satisfactory  justifications  to  the  competent  authorities  that  such  categories  are        not  relevant  to  the  legal  structure,  risk  profile,  size  and/or  complexity  of  the  institution  (i.e.  a        rebuttable  presumption):  	1
13.Institutions should include specific recovery plan indicators included in the list per category    provided in Annex II to these Guidelines, unless they provide	satisfactory  justifications  to  the        competent  authorities  that  such  specific  indicators  are  not  relevant  to  the  legal  structure,  risk        profile,  size  and/or  complexity  of  the  institution  (i.e.  a  rebuttable  presumption).  In  any  case              	1
14.Institutions should not limit their set of indicators to the minimum list set out in Annex II, and    should give consideration to the	inclusion  of  other  indicators  following  the  principles  laid  down        in  Title  II  and  in  line  with  the  description  of  the  categories  laid  down  in  the  following  titles  of        these  Guidelines.  With  this  aim,  Annex  III  includes  a  non-exhaustive  list  with  examples  of        additional  recovery  plan  indicators  broken  down  by  categories.              	1
15.The framework of recovery plan ind	icators should:       	1
16.While setting the quantitative recovery plan indicators, an institution should consider using    progressive metrics (‘traffic light approach’) in order to inform the institution’s	management        that  such  indicators  could  potentially  be  reached.            	1
17.An institution should recalibrate the recovery plan indicators when necessa	ry and at least    annually.   	1
18.An institution should be able to provide the competent authority with an explanation of how    the calibrations of the recovery plan indicators have	been  determined  and  to  demonstrate        that  the  thresholds  would  be  breached  early  enough  to  be  effective.  In  this  context,  the        magnitude  and  speed  of  the  breach  of  the  threshold  should  be  taken  into  account.          	1
19.The management information systems of the institution should ensure an easy and frequent    monitoring of the indicators by the institution and allow for	the  timely  submission  of  the        indicators  to  the  competent  authorities  upon  request.    	1
20.The monitoring of recovery plan indicators should be undertaken on a continuous basis to    ensure the institution can take appropriate measures in a	timely  manner  to  restore  its  financial        position  following  a  significant  deterioration.      	1
22.While selecting capital indicators, institutions should consider ways to address the issues    stemming from the fact that the capacity of such indicators to	allow  for  a  timely  reaction  can        be  lower  than  for  other  types  of  indicators,  and  certain  measures  to  restore  an  institution’s        capital  position  can  be  subject  to  longer  execution  periods  or  greater  sensitivity  to  market  and        other  conditions.  In  particular  this  can  be  achieved  by  means  of  establishing  forward-looking        projections,  which  should  consider  material  contractual  maturities  relating  to  capital        instruments.          	1
23.The capital indicators should also be integrated into the institution’s Internal Capital Adequacy    Assessment Process (ICAAP) pursuant to Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU	of  the  European        Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  26  June  2013  on  access  to  the  activity  of  credit  institutions        and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit  institutions  and  investment  firms,  amending        Directive  2002/87/EC            and          repealing            Directives    2006/48/EC              and          2006/49/EC        (‘Directive  2013/36/EU’),  and  its  existing  risk  management  framework.      	1
24.The thresholds should be calibrated based on the institution’s risk profile and on the time    needed to activate the recovery measures; should consider	the  recovery  capacity  resulting        from  those  measures;  and  take  into  account  how  quickly  the  capital  situation  may  change,        given  the  institution's  individual  circumstances.    	1
25.The thresholds for indicators based on regulatory capital requirements should be calibrated by    the institution at adequate levels in order to ensure a	sufficient  distance  from  a  breach  of  the        capital  requirements  applicable  to  the  institution  (including  minimum  own  funds  requirements        as  specified  in  Article  92  of  regulation  (EU)  575/2013  and  additional  own  funds  requirements        applied  pursuant  to  Article  104(1)(a)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  but  without  taking  into  account        any  buffer  requirements  set  out  in  Chapter  4  of  Title  VII  of  Directive  2013/36/EU).    	1
27.The institution's liquidity indicators should refer to both the short-term and long-term liquidity    and funding needs of the institution and capture the institution’s	dependence  on  wholesale        markets  and  retail  deposits,  distinguishing  among  key  currencies  where  relevant.  	1
28.The liquidity indicators should be integrated with the strategies, policies, processes and    systems developed by each institution pursuant to Article 86 of Directive	2013/36/EU  and  its        existing  risk  management  framework.              	1
29.The liquidity indicators should also cover other potential liquidity and funding needs, such as    the intra-group funding exposures and those stemming from off-balance	structures.    	1
30.The thresholds identified by the institution should be calibrated on the basis of the    institution’s risk profile and should take into account how	quickly  the  liquidity  situation  may        change,  given  the  institution's  individual  circumstances.      	1
31.The thresholds should be calibrated on the basis of the institution’s risk profile and on the time    needed to activate the recovery measures	and  consider  the  recovery  capacity  resulting  from        those  measures.  When  referring  to  minimum  regulatory  requirements  applicable  to  the        institution  (including  additional  liquidity  requirements  pursuant  to  Article  105  of        Directive  2013/36/EU,  if  applicable)  –  the  indicators  should  be  calibrated  by  the  institution  at        adequate  levels  in  order  to  be  able  to  inform  the  institution  of  potential  and/or  actual  risks  of        not  complying  with  those  minimum  requirements.              	1
32.Profitability indicators should capture any institution’s income-related aspect that could lead    to a rapid deterioration in the institution’s financial position through lowered retained	      earnings  (or  losses)  impacting  on  the  own  funds  of  the  institution.      	1
33.This category should include recovery plan indicators referring to operational risk-related    losses which may have a significant impact on the profit and loss	statement,  including  but  not        limited  to,  conduct-related  issues,  external  and  internal  fraud  and/or  other  events.            	1
34.Asset quality indicators should measure and monitor the asset quality evolution of the    institution. More specifically, they should indicate when asset quality deterioration	could  lead        to  the  point  at  which  the  institution  should  consider  taking  an  action  described  in  the  recovery        plan.            	1
35.The asset quality indicators may include both a stock and a flow ratio of non-performing    exposures in order to capture their level and	dynamics.    	1
36.The asset quality indicators should cover aspects such as off-balance sheet exposures and the	    impact of non-performing loans on the asset quality. 	1
37.Market-based indicators aim to capture the expectations from market participants of a rapidly    deteriorating financial condition of the institution that could potentially lead	to  disruptions  in        access  to  funding  and  capital  markets.  In  accordance  with  this  objective,  the  framework  of        qualitative  and  quantitative  indicators  should  refer  to  the  following  types  of  indicators:      	1
38.Macroeconomic indicators aim to capture signals of deterioration in the economic conditions	    where the institution operates, or of concentrations of exposures or funding.	1
39.The macroeconomic indicators should be based on metrics that influence the performance of    the institution in specific geographical areas or business sectors that	are  relevant  for  the        institution.    	1
40.The macroeconomic indicators should include the follo	wing typologies:      	1
10. For the purposes of disclosing information in summary or collective form according to     Article 84(3) of Directive 2014/59/EU, such that individual	institutions  or  entities  referred  to          in  point  (b),  (c)  or  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of  that  Directive  cannot  be  identified,  the  information          should  be  provided  either  by  means  of  a  brief  statement  or  on  an  aggregate  basis,  in          anonymised  form.              	1
11. For the purposes of paragraph 10 of these guidelines all the following factors should be     considered in order to ensure that	the  information  in  summary  or  collective  form  is  disclosed          in  anonymised  form:  	1
11.1.   Number of institutions: if the confidential information relates to fewer than three   institutions or entities	referred  to  in  point  (b),  (c)  or  (d)  of  Article  1(1)  of    Directive  2014/59/EU,  disclosure  should  be  avoided,  unless  the  specific  patterns,  as    specified  in  point  11.2  of  this  paragraph,  and  the  context  of  disclosure,  as  specified  in    point  11.3  of  this  paragraph,  do  not  create  a  risk  of  those  individual  institutions  or  entities    being  identified.            	1
11.2.   Specific patterns: when disclosing confidential information any reference to specific   characteristics, distinctive features, names or	to  numerical,  qualitative  or  other  distinctive    data  allowing  identification  of  the  individual  institutions  or  entities  referred  to  in  point        	1
11.3.   Context of disclosure: disclosure of confidential information should be avoided when a   set of circumstances	such  as  the  means  of  the  disclosure,  the  number  and  the    characteristics  of  the  addressees,  the  timing  of  the  disclosure  and  any  other  distinctive    circumstance  creates  a  risk  of  the  individual  institutions  or  entities  referred  to  in  point  (b),        	1
3. Competent authorities should ensure that institutions report their funding plans in  accordance with the harmonised templates and definitions	referred  to  in  the  funding  plan  template  attached  (Annex  I)  to  these  guidelines.        	1
    4. Competent authorities should ensure that institutions shall submit the Funding Plan  Template at least	annually,  reflecting  relevant  figures  as  at  reference  dates  and  by  the  submission  dates  described  in  paragraph  8.              	1
    5. Competent authorities should determine the appropriate level of consolidation for the  reporting of the	funding  plans  having  regard  to  the  following  considerations:    	1
    6.    Competent authorities should also provide the EBA with full transparency on the level of    	          consolidation  and  explanation  of  choices  to  facilitate  the  EBA’s  aggregation  of  the  data  for      EU-wide  purposes.  	1
7. Competent authorities should ensure that institutions comply effectively with the  guidelines to facilitate the reporting of funding plans	for  the  year  2014  and  thereafter  in  accordance  with  these  guidelines.            	1
    8. For the year 2014 and 2015 competent authorities should ensure that institutions report  their	funding  plans  with  a  reference  date  no  later  than  30  June  2015  by  30  September  2015  and  the  plans  are  submitted3  to  the  EBA  by  15  November  2015.  For  subsequent  years,  the  competent  authorities  should  ensure  that  institutions  report  their  funding  plans  in  accordance  with  these  guidelines  by  31  March  with  a  reference  date  of  31  December  of  the  previous  year,  and  the  plans  are  submitted  to  the  EBA  by  30  April  of  each  year.          	1
3  Competent authorities will be required to submit data to the EBA following a DPM and an XBRL taxonomy that will be published by the	EBA.    	1
10. The internal validation function of institution should verify the changes which are applied to     the rating systems as a result of	the  application  of  these  guidelines,  consistently  with  EBA  final          draft  regulatory  technical  standards  on  the  IRB  assessment  methodology  EBA/RTS/2016/03          [RTS  on  IRB  assessment  methodology]  of  21  July  2016  and  the  classification  of  the  changes  in          accordance  with  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  529/201411.        	1
11. Institutions that need to obtain prior permission from competent authorities in accordance     with Article 143(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and	Regulation  (EU)  No  529/2014  for  the          changes  in  the  rating  systems  required  to  incorporate  these  guidelines  for  the  first  time  by  the          deadline  referred  to  in  paragraph  9  should  agree  with  their  competent  authorities  the  final          deadline  for  submitting  the  application  for  such  prior  permission.    	1
12. Prior to the application of these guidelines, institutions need to identify the relevant downturn     periods for the type of exposure under	consideration  in  accordance  with  EBA  submitted  [RTS          on  economic  downturn].  The  guidelines  will  be  adapted,  where  relevant,  when  the  RTS  on          economic  downturn  are  published  in  their  final  version  in  the  OJ.          	1
13. For the purpose of quantifying LGDs that are appropriate for an economic downturn,   institutions should apply all	definitions  and  all  requirements  set  out  in  Section  4  Section  6    Section  7  Section  8  and  Section  9  of  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  PD  estimation,  LGD  estimation    and  the  treatment  of  defaulted  exposures  (EBA/GL/2017/16)  of  20/11/17  (EBA  GL  on  PD    and  LGD  estimation)  that  are  relevant  for  this  purpose.              	1
14. In addition to paragraph 13 for the purpose of quantifying downturn LGD institutions   should apply the following	requirements  specific  to  downturn  LGD  estimates  by  facility    grade  or  pool:          	1
15. Where institutions identify multiple downturn periods in accordance with the final draft   RTS on economic downturn submitted	by  EBA  [RTS  on  economic  downturn],        	1
    16. For the purpose of ensuring that the resulting downturn LGDs are used if they are more     	      conservative  than  the  according  long-run  average  LGDs  in  line  with  Article  181(1)(b)  of    Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  institutions  should  apply  the  following:          	1
    18. Institutions should compare the final downturn LGD with the reference value calculated in  	accordance  with  Section  8  on  the  according  RDS  and  calculated  at  least  at  the  level  of    calibration  segments.  Institutions  should  justify  any  material  difference  between  the  final    downturn  LGD  and  the  reference  value.      	1
    19. When comparing the final downturn LGD with the reference value in line with paragraph       	  18  institutions  should  take  into  account  all  of  the  following:            	1
20. For downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures, institutions should use the same   downturn period as identified for	the  corresponding  non-defaulted  exposures.            	1
21. For downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures for the downturn period referred to   in paragraph 20 institutions	should  comply  with  all  of  the  following:      	1
22. For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period   identified in accordance with Regulation	(EU)  xx/xx  [RTS  on  economic  downturn],    institutions  should  use  one  of  the  three  types  of  approaches  set  out  in  Section  5  Section  6    and  Section  7  of  these  guidelines  in  accordance  with  the  hierarchy  set  out  in  paragraphs  23    to  25  below.              	1
23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set   out in paragraph	27  they  should  calibrate  downturn  LGD  for  the  considered  downturn    period  in  accordance  with  Section  5  of  these  guidelines.  For  this  purpose,  institutions    should  ensure  that  the  relevant  loss  data  is  available  during  the  considered  downturn    period  as  well  as  during  an  appropriate  period  before  and  after  the  considered  downturn    period.        	1
24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn   period is not	available  but  it  is  possible  to  calibrate  downturn  LGD  for  the  considered    downturn  period  by  applying  the  approach  set  out  in  Section  6  institutions  should  calibrate    downturn  LGD  for  the  considered  downturn  period  in  accordance  with  Section  6  of  these    guidelines.  	1
25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn   period is not	available,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  quantify  downturn  LGD  for  the  considered    downturn  period  by  applying  the  approach  set  out  in  Section  6  institutions  should  calibrate    downturn  LGD  for  the  considered  downturn  period  in  accordance  with  Section  7  of  these    guidelines.              	1
26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LG	D institutions should adhere   to the following principles 	1
27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered   downturn period, institutions	should  carry  out  an  analysis  of  the  impact  of  this  downturn    period  on  the  loss  data  related  to  the  considered  calibration  segment.  	1
    28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27       	  institutions  should  calibrate  downturn  LGD  by  applying  an  estimation  methodology  which    is  coherent  with  the  evidence  obtained  from  the  impact  analysis.  	1
    29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of       	  a  downturn  period  on  an  institution’s  relevant  loss  data,  such  that  the  average  observed    realised  losses  in  this  downturn  period  are  not  different  from  those  under  other  economic    conditions,  the  institution  may  use  the  long-run  average  LGD  as  downturn  LGD,  where  all    of  the  following  applies:    	1
30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the   methodologies specified in paragraph	31  (‘haircut  approach’)  and  paragraph  32    (‘extrapolation  approach’)  or  a  combination  of  those.  Prior  to  quantifying  its  downturn  LGD    estimates,  institutions  should  choose  the  most  relevant  methodology  based  on:              	1
31. (‘Haircut approach’) For the purpose of these guidelines, a ‘haircut approach’ refers to an   approach for the	estimation  of  the  impact  of  the  downturn  period  on  realised  LGDs,    intermediate  parameters  or  risk  drivers  in  which  one  or  several  economic  factors  as    referred  to  in  Regulation  (EU)  xx/xx  [RTS  on  economic  downturn]  are  direct  or  transformed    input(s)  in  the  LGD  model  and  where  for  the  purpose  of  this  estimation  these  input(s)  are    adjusted  to  reflect  the  impact  of  the  downturn  period  under  consideration.  In  particular,    where  the  considered  economic  factor  relates  to  the  downturn  period  under  consideration,    the  haircut  should  be  based  on  the  most  severe  observation  of  this  economic  factor  in    accordance  with  the  specification  of  the  severity  of  an  economic  downturn  laid  down  in    Article  3  of  Regulation  (EU)  xx/xx  [RTS  on  economic  downturn].      	1
32. (‘Extrapolation Approach’) For the purposes of these guidelines, an ‘extrapolation   approach’ refers to the estimation of the	impact  of  the  downturn  period  under    consideration  on  LGDs,  intermediate  parameters  or  risk  drivers  if  all  of  the  following    conditions  are  met:              	1
33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the   impact of the respective downturn	conditions  under  consideration  on  an  intermediate    parameter  or  risk  driver  they  should  use  the  observed  data  in  combination  with  the  Haircut    or  Extrapolation  Approach  to  calibrate  downturn  LGD  for  the  considered  downturn  period    in  accordance  with  paragraph  30.        	1
34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the   purpose of	estimating  intermediate  parameters  or  risk  drivers,  they  should  ensure  that  the    dependency  structure  between  intermediate  parameters  or  risk  drivers  is  reflected    appropriately  in  the  aggregation  of  these  intermediate  parameters  or  risk  drivers  in    accordance  with  paragraph  30.          	1
35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive   Category A MoC	in  accordance  with  paragraph  37(a)(xi)  of  the  [EBA  GL  on  PD  and  LGD    estimation]  for  all  approaches  in  this  section.  In  particular,  institutions  applying  an    extrapolation  approach:    	1
36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under   consideration is not	available  and  it  is  also  not  possible  to  calibrate  downturn  LGD  for  the    considered  downturn  period  in  accordance  with  Section  6  of  these  guidelines,  institutions          	1
37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance 	with the following sequence   of steps:   	1
1.1.   Institutions should design and implement remuneration policies and practices that take  into account the rights and	interests  of  consumers.  In  particular,  institutions  should  ensure  that  monetary  and/or  non-monetary  forms  of  remuneration  do  not  introduce  incentives  whereby  relevant  persons  favour  their  own  interests,  or  the  institution’s  interests,  to  the  detriment  of  consumers.      	1
1.2.   When designing the remuneration policies and practices, institutions should consider  whether these policies and practices introduce	any  risks  of  detriment  to  consumers  and  should  mitigate  such  risks  from  arising.        	1
1.3.   The human resources function of institutions should participate in and inform the design of  the remuneration	policies  and  practices.  In  addition,  where  established,  the  risk  management  and  compliance  functions  should  provide  effective  input  for  the  design  of  the  remuneration  policies  and  practices.          	1
1.4.   For the purpose of evaluating the performance of a relevant person, institutions should  define in the	remuneration  policy  and  practices  the  appropriate  criteria  to  be  used  to  assess  performance,  taking  into  account  the  rights  and  interests  of  consumers.    	1
1.5.   When designing the remuneration policies and practices, institutions should consider both  qualitative and quantitative criteria for	determining  the  level  of  variable  remuneration  to  ensure  that  the  rights  and  interests  of  consumers  are  adequately  considered.            	1
1.6.   Institutions should not design remunera	tion policies and practices that:        	1
1.7.   Where the remuneration policies and practices allow for variable remuneration, institutions  should ensure that the ratio	between  the  fixed  and  variable  components  of  the  remuneration  is  appropriately  balanced  and  takes  into  account  the  rights  and  interests  of  consumers.  Furthermore,  the  remuneration  policies  and  practices  in  place  should  allow  the          	1
1.8.   Institutions should avoid unnecessarily complex policies and practices and unclear  c	ombinations of different policies and practices.	1
2.1.   Institutions should document remuneration policies and practices, keep them for audit  purposes for at least five	years  from  the  last  date  that  they  applied,  and  make  them  available  to  the  competent  authorities  upon  request.  This  documentation  should  include,  but  is  not  limited  to:        	1
2.2.   Before being allowed to offer banking products or services to consumers, relevant persons  should be clearly	informed  in  a  simple  and  transparent  manner  of  the  remuneration  policies  and  practices  that  are  applicable  to  them.            	1
2.3.   The remuneration policies and practices should be easily accessible t	o all relevant persons  of the institution.	1
3.1.   The management body approves and retains ultimate responsibility for the institution’s	  remuneration policies and practices. 	1
3.2.   The management body should seek advice from the remuneration committee where  established on the institution’s remuneration	policies  and  practices  in  relation  to  the  fulfilment  of  these  Guidelines.            	1
3.3.   Where established, the compliance function should confirm that the remuneration policies  and practices comply with these	Guidelines.    	1
3.4.   Changes to the remuneration policies and practices should only be made with the approval  of the	management  body.  	1
4.1    Institutions should review, at least annually, their remuneration policies and practices to  ensure compliance with	these  Guidelines.  In  particular,  where  an  institution  identifies  that  a  residual  risk  of  consumers’  detriment  might  arise  as  a  result  of  the  design  of  remuneration  policies  and  practices  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  1.2  of  these  Guidelines,  the  institution  should  assess  under  the  review  whether  any  of  these  residual  risks  are  crystallising  and  causing  detriment  to  consumers.    	1
4.2    Where the review reveals that an institution’s remuneration policies and practices do not  operate as	intended  or  prescribed,  the  institution  should  amend  its  remuneration  policies  and  practices  in  accordance  with  these  Guidelines.              	1
4.3    Institutions should establish effective controls to check that their remuneration policies and  practices are being	adhered  to,  and  to  identify  and  address  incidents  of  non-compliance  with  these  Guidelines.        	1
11.Institutions should treat IRRBB as an important risk and always assess it explicitly and    comprehensively in their risk management processes and internal capital	assessment  processes.        A  different  approach  should  be  fully  documented  and  justified  in  the  course  of  the  supervisory        dialogue.              	1
12.Institutions should identify their IRRBB exposures and ensure that IRRBB is adequately     	measured, monitored and controlled.      	1
13.Institutions should manage and mitigate risks arising from their IRRBB exposures that affect both     	 their earnings and economic value.  	1
14.When calculating the impact of interest rate movements in the earnings perspective, institutions    should consider not only the effects on interest income and	expenses,  but  also  the  effects  of  the        market  value  changes  of  instruments  —  depending  on  accounting  treatment  —  either  shown  in        the  profit  and  loss  account  or  directly  in  equity  (e.g.  via  other  comprehensive  income).        Institutions  should  take  into  account  the  increase  or  reduction  in  earnings  and  capital  over  shortand  medium-term  horizons  resulting  from  interest  rate  movements.              	1
15.The change in earnings should be the difference between expected earnings under a base    scenario and expected earnings under an alternative, more adverse	shock  or  stress  scenario        from  a  going-concern  perspective.            	1
16.Institutions should consider non-performing exposures 6 (net of provisions) as interest rate 	   sensitive instruments reflecting expected cash flows and their timing.  	1
17.Institutions should consider interest rate derivatives, as well as off-balance-sheet items such as 	   interest rate sensitive loan commitments, as interest rate sensitive instruments.	1
18.Institutions should monitor and assess their CSRBB-affected exposures, by reference to the asset    side of the non-trading book, where CSRBB is relevant for	the  risk  profile  of  the  institution.        	1
19.When implementing the guidelines, institutions should identify their existing and prospective    exposure to IRRBB in a proportionate manner, depending on the level, complexity	and  riskiness        of  the  non-trading  book  positions  they  face,  or  an  increasing  risk  profile  taking  into  account  their      	1
6   Non-performing exposures as defined in Annex V of  	Regulation (EU) 680/2014.     	1
20.Based upon the assessment of their existing and prospective exposure to IRRBB, institutions    should consider elements and expectations stipulated in this section and	in  the  sections  on        capital  identification,  calculation  and  allocation  (section  4.2.),  governance  (section  4.3.)  and        measurement  (section  4.4.)  and  implement  them  in  a  way  that  is  commensurate  with  existing        and  prospective  exposure  to  IRRBB.    	1
21.In addition to the existing and prospective exposure to IRRBB, when implementing the    guidelines, institutions should also consider their general level of sophistication	and  internal        approaches  to  risk  management  to  make  sure  that  their  approaches,  processes  and  systems  for        the  management  of  IRRBB  are  coherent  with  their  general  approach  to  risk  management  and        their  specific  approaches,  processes  and  systems  implemented  for  the  purpose  of  the        management  of  other  risks.  	1
22.When evaluating the amounts, types and distributions of internal capital pursuant to Article 73    of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should base the contribution of	IRRBB  to  the  overall        internal  capital  assessment  on  the  institution’s  internal  measurement  systems  outputs,  taking        account  of  key  assumptions  and  risk  limits.  The  overall  level  of  capital  should  be  commensurate        with  both  the  institution’s  actual  measured  level  of  risk  (including  for  IRRBB)  and  its  risk        appetite,  and  be  duly  documented  in  its  report  on  the  Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment        Process  (ICAAP  report).      	1
23.Institutions should demonstrate that their internal capital is commensurate with the level of    IRRBB, taking into account the impact on internal capital of	potential  changes  in  the  institution’s        economic  value  and  future  earnings  resulting  from  changes  in  interest  rates.  Institutions  are  not        expected  to  double-count  their  internal  capital  for  EV  and  earning  measures.    	1
24.In their ICAAP analysis of the amount of internal capital required for IRRBB,	 institutions should    consider:       	1
25.Institutions should not only rely on the supervisory assessments of capital adequacy for IRRBB    or on the outcome of the supervisory outlier test	(see  section  4.5.),  but  should  develop  and  use        their  own  methodologies  for  capital  allocation,  based  on  their  risk  appetite,  level  of  risk  and  risk        management  policies.  In  determining  the  appropriate  level  of  capital,  institutions  should        consider  both  the  amount  and  the  quality  of  capital  needed.          	1
26.Capital adequacy assessments for IRRBB should take into	 account the following:         	1
27.The outcomes of the capital adequacy for IRRBB should be considered in an institution’s ICAAP    and flow through to the assessments of capital	associated  with  business  lines.            	1
28.To calibrate the amount of internal capital to be held for IRRBB, institutions should use    measurement systems and a range of interest rate	shock  and  stress  scenarios,  which  are        adapted  to  the  risk  profile  of  the  institution  in  order  to  quantify  the  potential  scale  of  any  IRRBB        effects  under  adverse  conditions.        	1
29.Institutions that operate economic capital models should ensure that the internal capital    allocation for IRRBB is properly factored into the overall economic capital	allocation  and  that        any  assumptions  on  diversification  are  documented  and  their  reliability  as  well  as  stability  is        verified  using  historical  data  appropriate  for  the  individual  institution  and  the  markets  in  which        it  operates.  Economic  capital  costs  may  be  allocated  back  to  the  business  units  and  products  to        ensure  that  the  full  costs  of  the  underlying  business  units  or  products  are  properly  understood        by  those  responsible  for  managing  them.        	1
30.In considering whether or not an allocation of internal capital should be made in respect of    IRRBB to earnings, institutions should take into	account  the  following:              	1
 31.Institutions should consider internal capital buffer adjustments where the results of their     stress testing highlight the potential for reduced earnings (and	therefore  reduced  capital          generation  capacity)  under  stress  scenarios.          	1
32.The IRRBB strategy of the institution, including the risk appetite for IRRBB and IRRBB mitigation,    should be part of the overall strategy, in	particular  the  strategic  objectives  and  risk  objectives,        which  the  management  body  must  approve  as  laid  down  in  subparagraph  (2),  letter  (a)  of        Article  88(1)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.          	1
33.The institution’s risk appetite for IRRBB should be expressed in terms of the acceptable impact    of fluctuating interest rates on both earnings and	economic  value  and  should  be  reflected  in        limits.  Institutions  with  significant  exposures  to  gap  risk,  basis  risk  or  option  risk  should        determine  their  risk  appetite  in  relation  to  each  of  these  material  sub-types  of  IRRBB.        	1
34.The overall IRRBB strategy should also include the decision about the extent to which the    business model relies on generating earnings by ‘riding	the  yield  curve’,  i.e.  funding  assets  with        a  comparatively  long  repricing  period  with  liabilities  with  a  comparatively  short  repricing  period.        Where  the  business  model  relies  heavily  on  this  source  of  earnings,  the  management  body          	1
35.Institutions should duly assess proposals to use new products, or engage in new activities, risktaking or hedging strategies, prior to acquisition or implementation to ensure that	the  resources        required  to  establish  sound  and  effective  IRRBB  management  of  the  product  or  activity  have        been  identified,  that  the  proposed  activities  are  in  line  with  the  institution’s  overall  risk  appetite,        and  that  procedures  to  identify,  measure,  monitor  and  control  the  risks  of  the  proposed  product        or  activity  have  been  established.  It  should  be  ensured  that  the  IRRBB  characteristics  of  these        new  products  and  activities  are  well  understood.        	1
36.Institutions using derivative instruments to mitigate IRRBB exposures should possess the    necessary knowledge and expertise. Each institution should demonstrate that it understands 	    the  consequences  of  hedging  with  interest  rate  derivatives.              	1
37.Institutions using models of customer behaviour as input for the measurement of their IRRBB    should possess the necessary knowledge and expertise. Each institution	should  be  able  to        demonstrate  that  it  understands  the  consequences  of  modelling  the  behaviour  of  its  customer        base.              	1
38.When making decisions on hedging activities, institutions should be aware of the effects of    accounting policies, but the accounting treatment should not drive	their  risk  management        approach.  The  management  of  economic  risks  should  therefore  be  a  priority,  and  the  accounting        impacts  managed  as  a  secondary  concern.    	1
39.Consolidating institutions should ensure that internal governance arrangements and processes    for the management of IRRBB are consistent and well integrated on a consolidated	and  a  subconsolidated  basis.            	1
40.In view of having internal governance arrangements pursuant to Article 74 and 88 of    Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should, in relation to IRRBB, ensure	the  following:  	1
41.The management body should, in particular, be	 responsible for the following:         	1
42.Institutions should have delegation arrangements and procedures in place for any delegation by    the management body of the monitoring or management of IRRBB,	including,  but  not  limited        to,  the  following:              	1
43.Institutions should articulate their risk appetite for IRRBB in terms of the risk to both economic    	value and earnings in particular:  	1
44.Institutions should implement limits that target maintaining IRRBB exposures consistent with    their risk appetite and with their overall approach for measuring IRRBB, in	particular  the        following:        	1
45.A framework should be in place to monitor the evolution of hedging strategies that rely on    instruments such as derivatives, and to control	mark-to-market  risks  in  instruments  that  are        accounted  for  at  market  value.      	1
46.The management body should, based on its overall IRRBB strategy, adopt robust risk policies,  	  processes and systems which should ensure that:  	1
47.The policies should be well reasoned, robust and documented and should address all IRRBB    components that are important to the institution’s individual circumstances.	Without  prejudice        to  the  proportionality  principle,  the  IRRBB  policies  should  include  the  following:  	1
48.All IRRBB policies should be reviewed regularly,	 at least annually, and revised as needed.      	1
49.To ensure that the institution’s IRRBB management policies and procedures remain appropriate    and sound, the management body or its delegates should review the	IRRBB  management        policies  and  procedures  in  the  light  of  the  outcomes  of  regular  reports.              	1
50.The management body or its delegates should ensure that analysis and risk management    activities related to IRRBB are conducted by sufficient and competent	staff  with  technical        knowledge  and  experience,  consistent  with  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  institution’s  activities.          	1
51.With regard to IRRBB control policies and procedures, institutions should have appropriate    approval processes, exposure limits, reviews and other mechanisms designed to provide	a        reasonable  assurance  that  risk  management  objectives  are  being  achieved.        	1
52.Institutions should undertake regular reviews and evaluations of their internal control systems    and risk management processes, seeking assurance that personnel comply with established	      policies  and  procedures.  Such  reviews  should  also  address  any  significant  changes  that  may        affect  the  effectiveness  of  controls,  including  changes  in  market  conditions,  personnel,        technology  and  structures  of  compliance  with  exposure  limits,  and  ensure  that  there  are            	1
53.Institutions should have their IRRBB identification, measurement, monitoring and control    processes reviewed by an independent auditing function, which may be an internal or	external        auditor,  on  a  regular  basis.  In  such  cases,  reports  written  by  internal  or  external  auditors  or  other        equivalent  external  parties  should  be  made  available  to  relevant  competent  authorities.      	1
54.The IT systems and applications used by the institution to carry out, process and record    operations, to identify, measure and aggregate IRRBB exposures,	and  to  generate  reports  should        be  capable  of  supporting  the  management  of  IRRBB  in  a  timely  and  accurate  manner.  In        particular,  the  systems  should:  	1
55.The IT system and transaction system should be capable of recording the repricing profile,    interest rate characteristics (including spread) and option characteristics of	the  products  to        enable  measurement  of  gap  risk,  basis  risk  and  option  risk.  In  particular,  the  transaction  system        should  be  able  to  gather  detailed  information  on  the  repricing  date(s)  of  a  given  transaction,        interest  rate  type  or  index,  any  options  (including  early  repayment  or  redemption)  and  the  fees        relating  to  the  exercise  of  these  options.            	1
56.The systems used to measure IRRBB should be capable of capturing the IRRBB characteristics of    all products. The systems should also allow the	disaggregation  of  the  impact  of  individual  IRRBB        instruments  and  portfolios  at  the  risk  level  of  the  non-trading  book.      	1
57.For complex, structured products in particular, the transaction system should be able to gather    information about the separate parts of the product and	to  capture  their  IRRBB  characteristics        (e.g.  the  characteristics  of  assets  and  liabilities  grouped  by  certain  characteristics  such  as        repricing  dates  or  optionality  elements).  The  institution  should  ensure  that  the  IT  system  is  able        to  keep  pace  with  the  introduction  of  new  products.  	1
58.Adequate organisational controls of IT systems should be in place to prevent the corruption of    data used by IRRBB computer systems and applications,	and  to  control  changes  to  the  coding        used  in  those  applications,  so  as  to  ensure,  in  particular:        	1
59.Risk measures should be based on reliable market and internal data. Institutions should    scrutinise the quality of external sources of information used to	establish  the  historical        databases  of  interest  rates,  as  well  as  the  frequency  at  which  databases  are  updated.        	1
60.To ensure the high quality of data, institutions should implement appropriate processes that    ensure that the data entered into the IT system is	correct.  Data  inputs  should  be  automated  as        much  as  possible  to  reduce  administrative  errors,  and  data  mapping  should  be  periodically        reviewed  and  tested  against  an  approved  model  version.  In  addition,  there  should  be  sufficient        documentation  of  the  major  data  sources  used  in  the  institution’s  risk  measurement  process.        Institutions  should  also  establish  appropriate  mechanisms  to  verify  the  correctness  of  the        aggregation  process  and  the  reliability  of  model  results.  These  mechanisms  should  confirm  the        accuracy  and  reliability  of  data.            	1
61.Where institutions slot cash flows into different time buckets (e.g. for gap analyses) or assign    the cash flows to different vertex points to	reflect  the  different  tenors  of  the  interest  rate  curve,        the  slotting  criteria  should  be  stable  over  time  to  allow  a  meaningful  comparison  of  risk  figures        over  different  periods.        	1
62.Institutions should identify potential reasons for discrepancies and irregularities that may arise    at the time of data processing. Institutions should have procedures in	place  to  handle  those        discrepancies  and  irregularities,  including  procedures  for  the  mutual  reconciliation  of  positions        to  enable  these  discrepancies  and  irregularities  to  be  eliminated.  	1
63.Institutions should set up appropriate processes to ensure that the data used to feed models    measuring the IRRBB across the group — e.g.	for  simulating  earnings  —  is  consistent  with  the        data  used  for  financial  planning.  	1
64.Institutions’ internal risk-reporting systems should provide timely, accurate and comprehensive    information about their exposures to IRRBB. The frequency of internal reports should be	at  least        quarterly.        	1
65.The internal reports should be provided to the management body or its delegates with    information at relevant levels of aggregation (by consolidation level	and  currency),  and  reviewed        regularly.  The  reports  should  contain  a  level  of  information  adapted  to  the  particular        management  level  (e.g.  management  body,  senior  management)  and  to  the  specific  situation  of        the  institution  and  the  economic  environment.              	1
66.The IRRBB reports should provide aggregate information as well as sufficient supporting detail    to enable the management body or its delegates to assess	the  sensitivity  of  the  institution  to        changes  in  market  conditions  and  other  important  risk  factors.  The  content  of  the  reports  should        reflect  changes  in  the  risk  profile  of  the  institution  and  in  the  economic  environment,  and        compare  current  exposure  with  policy  limits.  	1
67.The IRRBB reports should, on a regular basis, include the results of the model reviews and audits    as well as comparisons of past	forecasts  or  risk  estimates  with  actual  results  to  inform  potential        modelling  shortcomings.  In  particular,  institutions  should  assess  the  modelled  prepayment        losses  against  historical  realised  losses.  Portfolios  that  may  be  subject  to  significant  mark-tomarket  movements  should  be  clearly  identified  and  the  impact  should  be  monitored  within  the        institution’s  MIS  and  subject  to  oversight  in  line  with  any  other  portfolios  exposed  to  market        risk.            	1
68.While the types of reports prepared for the management body or its delegates will vary based    on the institution’s portfolio composition, they should	include,  taking  into  account        paragraph  65  the  following:            	1
69.Based on these reports, the management body or its delegates should be able to assess the    sensitivity of the institution to changes in	market  conditions  and  other  important  risk  factors,        with  particular  reference  to  portfolios  that  may  potentially  be  subject  to  significant  mark-tomarket  movements.              	1
70.The internal measurement system should generate reports in a format that allows the different    levels of the institution’s management to understand the reports	easily  and  to  make  appropriate        decisions  in  a  timely  manner.  The  reports  should  constitute  the  basis  for  regular  monitoring  of        whether  or  not  the  institution  operates  in  line  with  its  strategy  and  the  interest  rate  risk  limits        it  has  adopted.      	1
71.Institutions should ensure that the validation of IRRBB measurement methods — which should    be reviewed and validated independently of their development — and	the  assessment  of        corresponding  model  risk  are  included  in  a  formal  policy  process  that  should  be  reviewed  and        approved  by  the  management  body  or  its  delegates.  The  policy  should  be  integrated  within  the        governance  processes  for  model  risk  management  and  should  specify:  	1
72.The validation framework should include the follo	wing four core elements:    	1
73.In addressing the expected initial and ongoing validation activities, the policy should establish a    hierarchical process for determining model risk soundness based on	both  quantitative  and        qualitative  dimensions  such  as  size,  impact,  past  performance  and  staff  expertise  with  the        modelling  technique  employed.            	1
74.Model risk management for IRRBB measures should follow a holistic approach that begins with    motivation, development and implementation by model owners and users.	Prior  to  receiving        internal  approval  for  usage,  the  process  for  determining  model  inputs,  assumptions,  modelling        methodologies  and  outputs  should  be  reviewed  and  validated  independently  of  the        development  of  IRRBB  models.            	1
75.The review and validation results and any recommendations on model usage should be    presented to and approved by the management body or its	delegates.  Upon  approval,  the  model        should  be  subject  to  ongoing  review,  process  verification  and  validation  at  a  frequency  that  is        consistent  with  the  level  of  model  risk  determined  and  approved  by  the  institution.            	1
76.The ongoing review process should establish a set of exception trigger events that obligate the    model reviewers to notify the management body or	its  delegates  in  a  timely  fashion,  in  order  to        determine  corrective  actions  and  restrictions  on  model  usage.  Clear  version  control        authorisations  should  be  designated,  where  appropriate,  to  model  owners.      	1
77.On the basis of observations and new information gained over time, an approved model may be    modified or withdrawn. Institutions should articulate policies	for  model  transition,  including        change  and  version  control  authorisations  and  documentation.      	1
78.Institutions may rely on third-party IRRBB models to manage and control IRRBB, provided that    these models are adequately customised to properly reflect the	specific  characteristics  of  the        institution  in  question.  Institutions  are  expected  to  fully  understand  the  underlying  analytics,        assumptions  and  methodologies  of  the  third-party  models  and  to  ensure  that  they  are        adequately  integrated  into  the  institutions’  overall  risk  management  systems  and  processes.        Where  third  parties  provide  input  for  market  data,  behavioural  assumptions  or  model  settings,        the  institution  should  have  a  process  in  place  to  determine  if  those  inputs  are  reasonable  for  its        business  and  the  risk  characteristics  of  its  activities.  Institutions  should  ensure  there  is  adequate        documentation  of  their  use  of  third-party  models,  including  any  specific  customisation.            	1
79.Model inputs or assumptions, whether stemming from internal model processes or from third    parties, should be included in the validation process. The institution	should  document  and        explain  model  specification  choices  as  part  of  the  validation  process.  	1
80.Institutions should implement robust internal measurement systems (IMSs) that capture all    components and sources of IRRBB which are relevant for the institution’s business	model.    	1
81.Institutions should measure their exposure to IRRBB in terms of potential changes to both the    economic value (EV) and earnings. Institutions should use	complementary  features  of  both        approaches  to  capture  the  complex  nature  of  IRRBB  over  the  short-term  and  long-term  time        horizons.  In  particular,  institutions  should  measure  and  monitor  (i)  the  overall  impact  of  key        modelling  assumptions  on  the  measurement  of  IRRBB  in  terms  of  both  economic  value        measures  and  earnings  measures,  and  (ii)  the  IRRBB  of  their  banking  book  interest  rate        derivatives  where  relevant  for  the  business  model.            	1
82.If commercial margins and other spread components are excluded from economic value    measures, institutions should (i) use a transparent methodology for identifying the	risk-free  rate        at  inception  of  each  instrument;  and  (ii)  use  a  methodology  that  is  applied  consistently  across        all  interest  rate  sensitive  instruments  and  all  business  units.            	1
83.When calculating earnings measures, institutions should incl	ude commercial margins.     	1
84.Institutions should consider non-performing exposures (net of provisions) as interest rate 	    sensitive instruments reflecting expected cash flows and their timing.  	1
85.When measuring their exposure to IRRBB, institutions should not purely rely on the calculation    and outcomes of the supervisory outlier tests as described	in  section  4.5,  or  any  additional        outlier  test  developed  by  the  competent  authority,  but  should  develop  and  use  their  own        assumptions  and  calculation  methods.  However,  the  supervisory  outlier  tests  should  be  fully        integrated  into  the  internal  framework  for  the  management  of  IRRBB  and  should  be  used  as        complementary  tools  for  measuring  exposure  to  IRRBB.              	1
86.Institutions should not rely on a single measure of risk but should instead use the range of    quantitative tools and models that corresponds	to  their  specific  risk  exposure.  To  that  end,        institutions  should  consider  the  application  of  the  methods  listed  in  Annex  I  but  not  limited  to        those,  to  ensure  that  various  aspects  of  interest  rate  risk  are  captured  adequately.    	1
87.The limitations of each quantitative tool and model used should be fully understood by the    institution, and these limitations should be taken into	account  in  the  IRRBB  risk  management        	1
88.Institutions should identify and measure all components of IRRBB. In order to identify different    components of IRRBB, institutions should at least consider those	approaches  as  shown  in        Table  1.  	1
89.For measuring and monitoring of IRRBB, institutions should use at least one earnings-based    measure and at least one economic value measurement method that,	in  combination,  capture        all  components  of  IRRBB.  Large  institutions  with  cross-border  activities,  in  particular  institutions        under  categories  1  and  2  of  the  SREP  Guidelines,  and  institutions  with  complex  or  sophisticated        business  models,  should  use  multiple  measurement  methods,  as  further  specified  in  Annex  II.              	1
90.Institutions should regularly, at least quarterly and more frequently in times of increased    interest rate volatility or increased IRRBB levels, measure their exposure	to  IRRBB  in  terms  of          	1
91.Institutions should also consider whether to apply a conditional or unconditional cash flow    modelling approach. Larger and more complex institutions, in particular institutions	under        categories  1  and  2  of  the  SREP  Guidelines,  should  also  take  into  account  scenarios  where        different  interest  rate  paths  are  computed  and  where  some  of  the  assumptions  (e.g.  relating  to        behaviour,  contribution  to  risk,  and  balance  sheet  size  and  composition)  are  themselves        functions  of  changing  interest  rate  levels.          	1
92.Institutions should assess exposures in each currency in which they have positions. For the    material currency exposures, the interest rate shock scenarios should	be  currency-specific  and        consistent  with  the  underlying  economic  characteristics.  Institutions  should  include  in  their        internal  measurement  systems  methods  to  aggregate  their  IRRBB  across  different  currencies.        Where  institutions  make  use  of  assumptions  about  dependencies  between  interest  rates  in        different  currencies,  they  should  have  the  necessary  level  of  skills  and  sophistication  to  do  so.        Institutions  should  take  into  account  the  impact  of  assumptions  regarding  dependencies        between  interest  rates  across  different  currencies.              	1
93.When selecting interest rate shock scenarios, institutions 	should consider the following:         	1
94.In low interest rate environments, institutions should also consider negative interest rate    scenarios and the possibility of asymmetrical effects of negative interest rates	on  their  interest        rate  sensitive  instruments.  	1
95.The results of shock scenarios should feed into the decision-making at appropriate management    level. This includes strategic or business decisions, the allocation of	internal  capital,  and  risk        management  decisions  by  the  management  body  or  its  delegates.  The  results  should  also  be        considered  when  establishing  and  reviewing  the  policies  and  limits  for  IRRBB.      	1
96.IRRBB stress testing should be considered in the ICAAP, where institutions should undertake    rigorous, forward-looking stress testing that identifies the potential adverse consequences	of        severe  changes  in  market  conditions  on  their  capital  or  earnings,  including  through  changes  in        the  behaviour  of  their  customer  base.  Stress  testing  for  IRRBB  should  be  integrated  into        institutions’  overall  stress-testing  framework,  including  reverse  stress  testing,  and  should  be        commensurate  with  their  nature,  size  and  complexity,  as  well  as  their  business  activities  and        overall  risk  profile.  	1
97.IRRBB stress testing should be performed regularly, at least annually and more frequently in    times of increased interest rate volatility and increased IRRBB	levels.    	1
98.The IRRBB stress-testing framework should include clearly defined objectives, scenarios tailored    to the institution’s businesses and risks, well-documented assumptions and sound  	  methodologies.  	1
99.In enterprise-wide stress tests, the interaction of IRRBB with other risk categories (e.g. credit    risk, liquidity risk, market risks), and any material second-round	effects,  should  be  computed.            	1
100. Institutions should perform reverse stress tests in order to (i) identify interest rate    scenarios that could severely threaten an institution’s capital and	earnings;  and  (ii)  reveal        vulnerabilities  arising  from  its  hedging  strategies  and  the  potential  behavioural  reactions  of  its        customers.              	1
101. In testing vulnerabilities under stressed conditions, institutions should use larger and more    extreme shifts and changes in interest rates than those used	for  the  purpose  of  ongoing        management,  including  at  least  the  following:      	1
102. The results of stress scenarios should feed into the decision-making at the appropriate    management level. This includes strategic or business decisions, the	allocation  of  internal              	1
103. When measuring IRRBB, institutions should fully understand and document key    behavioural and modelling assumptions. These assumptions should be aligned with business 	    strategies  and  be  regularly  tested.      	1
104. Institutions should, in relation to both economic value and earnings-based measures of    IRRBB, take into account assumptions made for the purpose of	risk  quantification  in  relation  to        at  least  the  following  areas:        	1
105. As market conditions, competitive environments and strategies change over time,    institutions should review significant measurement assumptions at least annually, and more 	    frequently  during  rapidly  changing  market  conditions.    	1
106.     In assessing the implications of optionality, institutions	 should take into account:    	1
107. Institutions should have policies in place governing the setting of, and the regular    assessment of, the key assumptions for the treatment of	on-  and  off-balance-sheet  items  that          	1
108. In making behavioural assumptions about accounts without specific repricing dates for the	    purposes of interest rate risk management, institutions should:  	1
109. Where institutions decide to adopt a policy intended to stabilise earnings arising f	rom their    own equity, they should:    	1
110. In deciding the investment term assumptions for equity capital, institutions should avoid    taking income stabilisation positions that significantly reduce their capability to	adjust  to        significant  changes  in  the  underlying  economic  and  business  environment.      	1
111. The investment term assumptions used to manage the risks to earnings and economic value    sensitivity arising from equity capital should be considered	as  part  of  the  normal  corporate        planning  cycle,  and  such  assumptions  should  not  be  altered  just  to  reflect  a  change  in  the        institution’s  expectations  of  the  path  of  future  interest  rates.  Any  use  of  derivative  or  asset        portfolios  to  achieve  the  desired  investment  profile  should  be  clearly  documented  and        recorded.        	1
112. Where an institution has not set explicit assumptions for the investment term of equity    capital or sets assumptions that are explicitly short-term,	the  institution  should  make  sure  that        its  systems  and  management  information  can  identify  the  implications  of  its  chosen  approach        for  the  volatility  of  both  earnings  and  economic  value.        	1
113. Institutions should regularly, at least quarterly, calculate the impact on their EVE of a    sudden parallel 200 basis points shift of the	yield  curve.  Institutions  should  report  regularly,        at  least  annually,  to  the  competent  authority  the  change  in  EVE  that  results  from  the  calculation.        Where  the  decline  in  EVE  is  greater  than  20,00 %  of  the  institution’s  own  funds,  the  institution        should  inform  the  competent  authority  immediately.            	1
114. Institutions should regularly, at least quarterly, calculate the impact on their EVE of interest    rate shocks, applying scenarios 1 to 6 as	set  out  in  Annex  III.  Institutions  should  report  regularly,        at  least  annually  through  the  ICAAP  report,  to  the  competent  authority  the  change  in  EVE  that        results  from  the  calculation.  Where  the  decline  in  EVE  is  greater  than  15,00 %  of  the  institution’s          	1
115. When calculating the change in EVE for the purpose of paragraphs 113 and 114 institutions	    should in particular apply the following principles:	1
116. When computing the effects of the standard EVE outlier test, institutions should use the    calculation methods set out under the economic value	of  equity  headings  in  Annex  I  and        Annex  II.          	1
11.For the purposes of the correction of the modified duration calculation for all debt instruments    subject to prepayment risk, referred to in the	second  subparagraph  of  Article  340(3)  of        Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  institutions  should  apply  one  of  the  following:        	1
12.For the purposes of paragraph 11(a) institutions should apply the following formula to correct    the Modified Duration and compute a Corrected Modified Duration	(‘CMD’):    	1
13.For the purposes of paragraph 11(b), institutions should apply the following formula to recompute directly the CMD by repricing the instrument after a shift of 100	b.p.  in  the  IRR:            	1
14.The computation of the additional factor Ψ need only to be considered if material and should    never lead to a shorter CMD than	if  it  had  not  been  considered  in  the  calculation.  	1
15.For the purposes of assessing the additional factor Ψ in accordance with paragraph 13 of these    guidelines, institutions should take into account all	of  the  following:              	1
16.The assessment of the additional factor Ψ should be based on historical data, obtained from    the institutions’ own experience or from external sources.	Data  on  the  behavioural  factors        referred  to  in  paragraph  15(b)  may  be  obtained  from  the  assessment  of  other  balance  sheet        elements  subject  to  prepayment  risk,  such  as  those  observed  for  retail  clients  in  the  nontrading  book.      	1
17.Institutions should calibrate the additional factor Ψ by assessing significant divergences    between the real behaviour historically observed for a type of client and	the  theoretical        behaviour  that  would  have  been  envisaged  for  counterparties  acting  in  a  purely  rational  way.          	1
18.The calibration of the additional factor Ψ , due to behavioural factors referred to in paragraph    17 should be made where a relevant	amount  of  these  instruments  with  prepayment  risk  are        held  in  the  trading  book  and  especially  where  the  counterparties  are  retail  clients.  Additional        factors  should  not  be  considered  for  the  embedded  options  where  the  institution  has  the  right        to  call  for  an  early  termination  of  the  instrument.        	1
1.1 The creditor should establish, and keep up to date, procedures to detect, as early as possible, 	    consumers going into payment difficulties.	1
1.2 The creditor should establish, and keep up to date, policies and procedures for the effective     handling of and engagement with consumers	in  payment  difficulties.  The  consumer          engagement  policy  should  include  that  the  creditor  provides  adequate  information,  for          example,  through  websites  and  written  materials,  and  support  for  consumers  in  payment          difficulties.        	1
1.3 The creditor should provide adequate training for staff dealing with c 	onsumers in payment     difficulties.      	1
2.1 When a consumer goes into payment difficulties, the creditor should work with the     consumer to establish why the difficulties have arisen	and  for  the  creditor  to  take          appropriate  steps.          	1
2.2 Any interaction by the creditor with the consumer in relation to their payment difficultie	s     should respect the consumer’s privacy.  	1
2.3 The creditor, as well as any agents acting on behalf of the creditor, should maintain a level of     contact and communication	with  a  consumer  in  payment  difficulties  that  is  proportionate  to          the  information  requirements,  and  not  excessive.        	1
3.1 The creditor should communicate clearly and	 in plain language.    	1
3.2 The creditor should provide support and, at least, the following information to 	consumers in     payment difficulties:     	1
3.3 In cases where the consumer’s payment difficulties persist, the creditor should provide 	the     following information to the consumer:   	1
4.1 The creditor should take into account the individual circumstances of the consumer, the     consumer’s interests and rights and his/her ability to	repay  when  deciding  on  which  steps  or          forbearance  measures  to  take.  Forbearance  measures  may  include  one  or  both  of,  the          following  concessions  to  the  consumer:          	1
5.1 The creditor should document the reasons why the option(s) offered to the consumer are     appropriate for his/her individual circumstances and should	make  and  retain  adequate          records  of  its  dealings  with  the  consumer  in  payment  difficulties  for  a  reasonable  period  of          time.      	1
13. In accordance with Article 14(5) of Directive 2014/49/EU, the objectives of the cooperation    	 agreements should be to:    	1
14. DGSs or, where appropriate, designated authorities, should adhere to the multilateral     framework cooperation agreement (MFCA) between deposit guarantee schemes in the 	      European  Union  or  conclude  bilateral  or  multilateral  cooperation  agreements  with  all  other          relevant  DGSs  and,  where  appropriate,  designated  authorities  in  the  EU  by  8/12/2016.          	1
15. The terms and conditions of the MFCA are those set out in Annex 1 to these guidelines.     Where DGSs or, where appropriate,	the  designated  authorities,  need  to  further  specify          certain  elements  not  covered  by  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  MFCA,  they  may  supplement          such  agreement  with  bilateral  or  multilateral  agreements,  provided  that  the  terms  of  those          agreements  do  not  contradict  the  terms  and  conditions  specified  in  the  MFCA.          	1
16. DGSs or, where appropriate, designated authorities, should conclude bilateral or multilateral     cooperation agreements only where they intend that these cooperation agreements contain	        terms  which  go  beyond  the  level  of  detail  required  by  these  guidelines.  Such  agreements          should  be  based  on  relevant  terms  set  out  in  Annex  1  so  far  as  possible.            	1
17. Pursuant to Article 14(5) of Directive 2014/49/EU, cooperation agreements should, at least,     	cover the following three key areas:    	1
18. For each of these three outlined areas, this section includes a list of minimum core elements   	  of the cooperation agreements.  	1
19. Cooperation agreements between DGSs, or where appropriate, designated authorities, should     specify the following modalities for repaying depositors at branches of member credit	        institutions  authorised  in  other  Member  States  by  the  host  DGS  on  behalf  of  the  home  DGS,          pursuant  to  Article  14(2)  of  Directive  2014/49/EU:          	1
20. Cooperation agreements should specify the content and the process of sending the     notification of unavailability of deposits. The agreements should include relevant	contact          details,  including  email  addresses  and  phone  numbers.      	1
21. The home DGS should notify the host DGS, and the designated authority of the host Member     State in which the DGS is	not  the  designated  authority,  that  a  situation  of  unavailability  of          deposits,  as  defined  in  Article  2(1)(8)  of  Directive  2014/49/EU,  has  occurred.  The  notification          should  also  include  general  information  about  the  institution  where  the  unavailability  of          deposits  has  occurred,  including  an  estimate  of  the  magnitude  of  the  expected  payout,  the          amount  of  covered  deposits  and  number  of  eligible  depositors  in  the  branch,  the  currency  of          repayment  and  any  other  general  information  that  the  home  DGS  considers  useful  for  the          host  DGS  in  preparation  for  the  payout.        	1
22. The notification should be transmitted by the home DGS to the host DGS immediately upon     determination of unavailability of deposits. The host	DGS  should  receive  the  notification,          ahead  of  receiving  all  the  necessary  information  and  funds,  in  order  to  start  preparing  for  a          payout  as  soon  as  the  notification  is  received.            	1
23. While Article 4(9) of Directive 2014/49/EU requires DGSs to ensure the confidentiality and the     protection of the data pertaining to depositors’ accounts	and  the  processing  of  such  data  in          accordance  with  Directive  95/46/EC  4  it  should  not  preclude  cooperation  agreements  from          setting  more  stringent  standards,  provided  this  is  agreed  to  in  the  cooperation  agreement.      	1
24. Cooperation agreements should provide a deadline by which the home DGS should send all     the necessary information for the preparation of a	repayment  of  depositors  to  the  host  DGS.          The  deadline  should  be  no  later  than  two  working  days  of  the  Member  State  of  the  home  DGS          prior  to  the  deadline  for  making  the  repayable  amount  available  to  domestic  depositors,          including  where  the  home  DGS’s  repayment  deadline  is  longer  than  seven  working  days,          following  the  determination  of  unavailability  of  deposits  in  the  institution.  The  home  DGS          should  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  comply  with  the  deadline.  However,  the  home  DGS          may  defer  the  transfer  of  information  in  instances  in  which,  in  spite  of  all  reasonable  efforts,          the  home  DGS  is  not  able  to  comply  with  the  deadline,  due  to  the  need  to  obtain  additional          information  on  deposits  and  depositors,  or  because  its  internal  processes  make  it  impossible          to  obtain  the  information  within  the  deadline  or  to  process  the  host  depositors’  information          within  the  deadline  without  significantly  delaying  the  process  for  domestic  payout.  In  such          instances,  the  home  DGS  should  inform  the  host  DGS  of  the  delay  as  soon  as  possible  and          agree  on  a  new  estimated  deadline  which  should  not  be  later  than  the  deadline  for          transferring  the  funds  pursuant  to  paragraph  33.      	1
25. The home DGS should obtain the SCV in line with domestic deadlines for receiving this     information from the credit institution. It should	then  process  the  SCV  in  order  to  provide  the          host  DGS  with  only  the  relevant  instructions  for  payment  in  a  format  agreed  between  the          DGSs  and  specifying  the  amounts  to  be  paid  out  in  the  currency  agreed  in  the  cooperation          agreements.  The  information  to  be  transmitted  from  the  home  DGS  to  the  host  DGS  should          include:            	1
26. In the event that the home DGS does not have all the information needed, depending on the     method of payout of the	host  DGS,  the  home  DGS  should  ask  the  host  DGS  to  collect  the  4    Directive  95/46/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  24  October  1995  on  the  protection  of  individuals  with  regard  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data  (OJ  L  281  23.11.1995,  p.  31).  	1
27. The DGSs should inform one another promptl          	y of any updates to the data.   	1
28. The host DGS should strive to ensure that the repayable amount is available to depositors as     soon as possible, within three working	days  of  the  Member  State  of  the  host  DGS  after          receiving  all  the  necessary  information,  instructions  and  funds  from  the  home  DGS,  without  a          request  to  the  home  or  the  host  DGS  being  necessary.  	1
29. Following the initial payout, the host DGS should inform the home DGS in a documented     manner of the results of the payout,	including  the  distribution  and  making  of  payments  to          depositors,  a  report  on  any  issues  encountered  with  payouts  and  an  assessment  of  areas  of          the  process  and  of  the  cooperation  agreement  to  improve  in  the  future.  The  host  DGS  should          inform  the  home  DGS  regularly  about  progress  in  relation  to  further  repayments  made  after          the  expiration  of  the  deadline  set  out  in  paragraph  28.            	1
30. Cooperation agreements should provide that, after receiving notification of unavailability of     deposits from the home DGS, the host DGS will promptly provide	the  home  DGS  with  all  the          necessary  information  about  the  accounts  to  be  used  for  the  transfer  of  funds  from  the  home          DGS  to  the  host  DGS.  	1
31. The accounts and transfer method chosen should ensure utmost security of the funds 	and     timeliness of the transfer.    	1
32. Cooperation agreements should specify the deadline 	for providing the necessary funding.               	1
33. The home DGS should provide the host DGS with the necessary funds no later than the day on     which the repayable amount	should  be  made  available  to  domestic  depositors  after  the          determination  of  unavailability  of  deposits  in  the  institution,  including  where  the  home  DGS’s          deadline  for  making  the  repayable  amount  available  is  longer  than  seven  working  days,  as          allowed  under  Article  8(2)  of  Directive  2014/49/EU.    	1
34. Any funds advanced in excess to the host DGS should be refunded to the home DGS by no     later than three working	days  of  the  Member  State  of  the  host  DGS  after  the  finalisation  of          the  payout.      	1
         35. Where the home DGS’s deadline for making the payout amount repayable is longer than   	      seven  working  days,  the  host  DGS  should  inform  the  depositors,  either  directly  or  by              advertising  in  the  media,  about  the  possibility  of  a  payout  of  costs  of  living  upon  request.        	1
         36. The host DGS should, within one working day, notify the home DGS of a depositor request for	            a  cost  of  living  payout.  This  notification  should  include  all  relevant  information,  including:      	1
37. When a depositor requests a payout of a cost of living amount, either directly to the home         	        DGS  or  to  the  host  DGS,  the  home  DGS  should  strive  to  provide  the  host  DGS  with  all  the              necessary  information  and  funds  within  five  working  days  of  the  Member  State  of  the  home              DGS  after  receiving  the  request  or  being  notified  by  the  host  DGS,  for  the  host  DGS  to  be  able              to  ensure  that  depositors  have  access  to  an  appropriate  amount  of  their  covered  deposits  to              cover  their  costs  of  living  while  waiting  for  full  payout.              	1
         38. Where the full payout is imminent, or where a partial payout would significantly delay the full 	          payout  process,  the  DGSs  may  agree  to  forgo  partial  payout  in  the  interest  of  ensuring  prompt              full  payout.              	1
39. Cooperation agreements should outline the process for repaying temporary high balances by    	 the host DGS, which should happen in the following sequence:	1
40. Supplementary bilateral or multilateral cooperation agreements     	 should also specify the     following aspects:     	1
41. Cooperation agreements should specify that the currency of the repayment shall be the     currency determined under the law of the home DGS	and  should  be  communicated  by  the          home  DGS  to  the  host  DGS.            	1
42. Where the law of the home DGS allows for a choice between several currencies and where     that choice includes the option to	use  the  currency  of  the  host  DGS’s  Member  State,  that          option  should  be  used  primarily.  Where  practical,  and  legally  allowed,  upon  agreement          between  DGSs,  the  repayable  amount  may  be  available  in  multiple  currencies.    	1
43. Where there is a need for a currency exchange, the rate to be applied should be the spot rate     published by the	central  bank  of  the  home  DGS’s  Member  State  on  the  day  of  the          determination  of  unavailability  of  deposits  in  a  given  institution.      	1
44. The necessary funding referred to in paragraphs 32–34 should be provided in the currency of     repayment determined under the law of the	home  DGS  pursuant  to  paragraphs  41  and  42.          The  home  DGS  should  handle  the  necessary  currency  exchange  and  bear  the  necessary          currency  exchange  costs.        	1
45. Cooperation agreements should specify that the host DGS will handle communication with     depositors on behalf of the home DGS, including informing depositors	about  the          determination  of  unavailability  of  deposits  and  the  payout  by  the  host  DGS  on  behalf  of  the          home  DGS.  	1
46. In addition, where the home DGS has the capability to effectively handle communication with     depositors in the Member State in which the	branch  is  located,  including  the  capability  to          communicate  in  the  official  language  or  languages  of  the  host  DGS’s  Member  State,  the          agreement  may  provide  that  depositors  will  be  offered  an  explicit,  additional  option  to          communicate  directly  with  the  home  DGS.  In  practice,  this  means,  for  example,  that  the  letter          informing  depositors  about  the  member  credit  institution’s  failure  may  include  two  phone          numbers  –  one  for  the  host  DGS  and  another  for  the  home  DGS.          	1
47. Cooperation agreements should specify that the language to be used by DGSs in     communicating with the depositors in the context of a	repayment  is  the  official  language  or          languages  of  the  host  DGS’s  Member  State.  However,  both  home  and  host  DGSs  should  not          be  precluded  from  answering  correspondence  addressed  to  them  by  depositors  in  the  official          language  or  languages  of  the  home  DGS’s  Member  State  or  another  language  where  they          have  the  capability  to  do  so,  or  communicating  in  those  languages  with  depositors  who  have          accepted  to  receive  information  in  a  given  language.  	1
48. The home and the host DGSs or, where relevant, the designated authorities, should use     English to communicate with one another, unless they	agree  bilaterally  to  use  another          language  in  their  communication.    	1
49. Communication channels established to communicate with the depositors, and between the     home and the host DGSs, should guarantee sufficient levels of confidentiality	and  security.            	1
50. Cooperation agreements should specify the types of costs that the home DGS will reimburse     the host DGS for, including, but not limited	to,  costs  incurred  in  performing  the  following          tasks  attributable  to  the  payout:            	1
51. Eligible costs incurred by the host DGS should        	meet the following criteria:       	1
52. Cooperation agreements           	 may provide that:          	1
53. Where the host DGS is reimbursed following the payout, reimbursement details, such as time     to reimburse the costs or the applicable interest	rate,  should  be  agreed  upon  no  later  than          seven  days  after  the  initial  payout  of  covered  deposits.  	1
54. To further reinforce trust in DGSs’ ability to perform their function in the case of a payout in a     branch, prospective parties	to  the  agreement  may  agree  on  a  mutual  right  of  audit  of  their          partner  DGS’s  activities  related  to  the  payout  before  entering  into  the  cooperation          agreement,  and  at  any  point  after  the  agreement  is  reached.              	1
55. Such an audit, subject to the DGSs’ or, where relevant, the designated authorities’ agreement,     may take the form of, for example, oversight,	post-payout  review,  audit  of  costs  and          seconding  staff  during  payout,  and  may  be  performed  either  on-site  or  remotely.  Parties  to          the  agreement  may  agree  to  allow  the  home  DGS  to  conduct  an  audit  of  the  host  DGS’s          activities  related  to  the  payout  paid  for  by  the  home  DGS.        	1
56. Any costs arising from delays in the home DGS providing the host DGS with the instructions     for payment, the necessary information and	the  funds,  should  be  borne  by  the  home  DGS,          including  where  the  delays  impose  operational  costs  on  the  host  DGS.          	1
57. Where the delay is attributable to the host DGS’s actions, the host DGS should bear the costs     	arising from this delay. 	1
58. In accordance with Article 14(2) of the Directive 2014/49/EU, the host DGS shall not bear any     liability for any acts undertaken in	accordance  with  the  instructions  given  by  the  home  DGS.            	1
59. The home and the host DGS may bilaterally agree that, on a case-by-case basis and no earlier     than three months from the	notification  of  unavailability  of  deposits,  they  will  review  the          functioning  and  scope  of  the  practical  arrangements  and  infrastructure  needed  for          proportionate,  continued  operationalisation  of  payouts  by  the  host  DGS  in  accordance  with          this  section  5.1,  making  the  necessary  adjustments  to  it.        	1
60. Cooperation agreements between DGSs, or where appropriate, the designated authorities,     should specify the following modalities for the transfer of contributions and information	from          one  DGS  to  another  in  the  event  that  a  credit  institution  ceases  to  be  a  member  of  one  DGS          and  joins  another  DGS,  including  cross-border  and  domestic  transfers,  pursuant  to          Article  14(3)  of  Directive  2014/49/EU:    	1
61. Article 14(6) in connection with Article 4(9) of Directive 2014/49/EU requires effective     exchange of information between DGSs, in accordance with confidentiality and	the  protection          of  data  pertaining  to  depositors’  accounts.  It  also  requires  processing  of  data  to  be  done  in          accordance  with  Directive  95/46/EC.            	1
62. While the abovementioned provision ensures a common minimum set of standards of     confidentiality and data protection, it does not preclude cooperation agreements	from  setting          more  stringent  standards,  provided  that  this  is  agreed  to  in  the  cooperation  agreements.      	1
63. The provision of accurate data is a key step in ensuring an effective transfer of information     from one DGS to another. Cooperation	agreements  should  specify  the  deadline  for  the  DGS          which  the  member  credit  institution  is  leaving  (transferring  DGS)  to  notify  the  DGS  the          member  credit  institution  in  question  wants  to  join  (receiving  DGS)  about  the  intention  of  the          member  credit  institution  to  join  the  receiving  DGS  or,  where  a  member  credit  institution          communicates  to  the  receiving  DGS  its  intention  to  become  a  member  credit  institution  of          such  DGS,  to  notify  the  transferring  DGS  of  such  circumstance.  The  deadline  referred  to  above          should  begin  from  the  date  on  which:    	1
64. The deadline should be set before the institution formally leaves the transferring	 DGS and     joins the receiving one.    	1
65. The information to be transmitted should include anything that the transferring DGS and the     receiving DGS jointly consider as relevant, including and	where  available:            	1
66. The transferring DGS should not be required to obtain new information for the purpose of     transferring it to the receiving DGS. The	receiving  DGS  will  have  the  power  to  request  the          most  up-to-date  information  directly  from  the  institution  upon  accepting  it  as  a  member.      	1
67. The transferring DGS should be able to refuse to share information which, due to its sensitive     nature, may not be shared under	national  or  EU  law.        	1
68. Any costs of raising the funds by the transferring DGS, where, for example, the transferring     DGS has recently made a payout and	needs  to  collect  additional  funds  for  the  transfer  to  the          receiving  DGS,  should  be  borne  by  the  transferring  DGS.            	1
69. The receiving DGS should provide the transferring DGS with the account details and any other     relevant information to allow the transfer of	contributions.  The  chosen  accounts  and  funds          transfer  method  should  ensure  the  utmost  security  of  the  funds  and  the  timeliness  of  the          transfer.            	1
70. Cooperation agreements should acknowledge that the transferring DGS will provide funds in     the currency in which the contributions have originally been provided.	The  receiving  DGS          should  bear  the  costs  of  any  operations  related  to  currency  exchange.        	1
71. According to paragraph 13(d) of the EBA guidelines on payment commitments to deposit     guarantee schemes 5 where a credit institution ceases to	be  a  member  of  one  DGS  and  joins          another  DGS,  the  transferring  DGS  should  ensure  that  the  financial  means  corresponding  to          the  12  months  preceding  the  end  of  the  membership  are  transferred  to  the  receiving  DGS,          either  by:              	1
72. Cooperation agreements should specify the deadline by which the transferring DGS, where     relevant in agreement with the credit institution, shall decide which	of  the  two  options  to          pursue.  The  agreements  should  not  specify  the  option  in  advance,  as  the  decision  will  be  casespecific  .      	1
73. Where the transferring DGS decides to enforce the commitment and transfer the proceeds to     the receiving DGS, the provisions laid down in	the  above  section  on  modalities  for  advancing          the  regular  contributions  paid  during  the  last  12  months  preceding  the  end  of  membership          should  apply.          	1
74. Where the transferring DGS decides not to enforce the payment commitments, it should     engage with the receiving DGS to establish whether the	receiving  DGS  is  willing  to  accept  the          reassignment  of  those  payment  commitments.  The  reassignment  may  happen  only  when          both  DGSs  agree.  Where  the  receiving  DGS  refuses  reassignment,  the  transferring  DGS  should          enforce  the  payment  commitments  and  transfer  the  proceeds  to  the  receiving  DGS.    	1
75. A membership of a DGS is a necessary condition for a credit institution being allowed to take     deposits. In addition, the receiving	DGS  must  be  able  to  meet  its  obligations  towards  the          depositors  of  the  member  credit  institution  from  the  first  day.  Therefore,  a  credit  institution’s          transfer  of  membership  should  happen  seamlessly.  This  implies  that  the  transfer  of          contributions  from  one  DGS  to  another  should  happen  on  the  same  day  on  which  the          member  credit  institution  leaving  one  DGS  joins  the  other  DGS.  Arranging  the  transfer  on  the          same  day  also  removes  the  risk  of  the  transferring  DGS  using  the  funds  contributed  by  this          institution  in  a  payout  or  resolution  after  the  member  credit  institution  has  left  the          transferring  DGS.  	1
76. Where the receiving DGS is willing to take the risk of accepting the new member credit     institution without receiving the transfer on	the  same  day,  it  should  agree  the  deadline  for          the  transfer  with  the  transferring  DGS.      	1
77. The DGSs should communicate in English when transmitting information from one DGS to the     other DGS, unless they agree bilaterally that another	language  will  be  used.        	1
78. Cooperation agreements should specify that the receiving DGS is responsible for any costs     associated with transferring the contributions (whether funds or payment	commitments)          from  the  transferring  DGS,  and  any  other  costs  associated  with  the  transfer,  including          translations  of  requested  information.  However,  where  necessary,  the  costs  of  raising  funds          should  be  borne  by  the  transferring  DGS.          	1
79. Cooperation agreements should include a clause specifying that where delays in the provision     of information or funds occur, any costs arising from	the  consequences  of  such  delays  should          be  borne  by  the  DGS  responsible  for  the  delays.      	1
80. The cooperation agreement should outline whether, in accordance with the law in their     respective jurisdictions, the relevant DGSs agree, in principle, to	lend  to  one  another  on  a          voluntary  basis.      	1
81. Where the DGSs do not agree to lend to one another, either because their national law does     not allow them to lend	to  other  DGSs,  or  because  of  the  DGSs’  or  the  designated  authorities’          decision,  the  agreement  should  not  include  any  more  detail.  However,  where  the  DGSs  are          allowed  to  lend  under  their  national  law  but  decided  against  lending,  the  decision  not  to  lend          to  one  another  should  not  preclude  the  DGSs  from  lending  to  one  another  at  the  point  of          crisis.    	1
82. Where the DGSs intend to lend to one another, the cooperation agreement should specify in     how many working days the DGS receiving	a  loan  request  has  to  reach  a  decision  and  what          information  the  DGS  asking  for  a  loan  should  provide.  The  agreement  may  include  more  detail          about  the  repayment  deadline  and  interest  rate  charged,  under  the  conditions  set  out  in          Article  12(2)  of  Directive  2014/49/EU.  	1
83. Cooperation agreements should include a clause stating that any party may refer any dispute     about the interpretation of the agreement to the	EBA  in  accordance  with  Article  19  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  1093/2010.              	1
13. The EBA guidelines on harmonised definitions and templates for funding plans of credit     institutions under Recommendation A4 of ESRB/2012/2 (EBA/GL/2014/04) of 19	June  201415          are  repealed  with  effect  from  31  December  2020.  	1
15 The guidelines can be accessed                	at https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/liquidity-risk/guidelines-onharmonised    	1
14. Credit institutions should report their funding plans in accordance with the harmonised     instructions and templates referred to in Annex I and Annex	II  to  these  guidelines.        	1
15. Competent authorities should also provide the EBA with full transparency on the scope of     application of these guidelines and an explanation of	how  the  guidance  referred  to  in          paragraph  9  has  been  observed.              	1
16. Credit institutions should submit the information referred to in these guidelines in the data     exchange formats and representations specified by competent authorities,	respecting  the  data          point  definition  included  in  the  data  point  model  referred  to  in  Annex  XIV  and  the  validation          formulae  specified  in  Annex  XV  of  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  680/2014,  as          well  as  the  following  specifications:  	1
17. The data submitted by the credit institutions should be associa	ted with the following     information:        	1
18. Credit institutions should submit the information with         	 an annual frequency.       	1
19. Credit institutions should report their funding plans in	 accordance with these guidelines by             	1
15 March with a reference date of 31 Decem	ber of the previous year.              	1
20. Where credit institutions are permitted by national laws to report their financial information     based on their accounting year-end, which deviates from the	calendar  year-end,  the  latest          available  accounting  year-end  should  be  considered  as  the  reference  date.        	1
9. Competent authorities should collect the information from institutions regarding ICAAP and    ILAAP specified in these Guidelines in order to perform the following supervisory	assessments        as  specified  in  the  SREP  Guidelines:          	1
10. Competent authorities should ensure that the information collected from institutions s	hould     contain the following:        	1
11. Competent authorities should ensure that the institution provides them with the ‘reader’s     manual’ that is prepared as an overarching document facilitating the	assessment  of  ICAAP  and          ILAAP  documents.  To  this  end,  the  ‘reader’s  manual’  should  provide  an  overview  of  all  ICAAPand  ILAAP-related  documents  submitted  to  the  competent  authorities  and  their  status  (new,          unchanged,  changed  with  minor  edits,  etc.).  The  ‘reader’s  manual’  should  essentially  work  as          an  index  by  linking  the  specific  information  items  referred  to  in  these  Guidelines  with  the          11  FINAL  REPORT  ON  DRAFT  GUIDELINES  ON  ICAAP  AND  ILAAP  INFORMATION  COLLECTED  FOR  SREP  PURPOSES      	1
12. With regard to the collection of information specified in these Guidelines, competent     authorities should set out the operational procedures and notify institutions	subject  to  the          provision  of  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  information  about  the  following:            	1

14. Competent authorities should require an institution that falls under SREP Category 1 to     provide them at least with all information items referred	to  in  these  Guidelines  on  an  annual          basis.  Competent  authorities  should  endeavour  to  set  a  single  remittance  date  and  a  single          reference  date  for  all  SREP  Category  1  institutions;  however,  depending  on  the  organisation          of  SREP  processes,  institution-specific  dates  may  be  set,  where  this  is  deemed  more          appropriate.              	1
15. For non-Category 1 institutions referred to in Section 2.4 of the SREP Guidelines	 competent     authorities may:      	1
16. Depending on the quality of the information provided and the assessment of whether the     document(s) submitted cover all areas specified in these	Guidelines,  competent  authorities          may  request  institutions  to  provide  additional  information  needed  for  the  assessment  of          ICAAP  and  ILAAP  within  the  SREP.  Competent  authorities  should  determine  the  appropriate          level  of  granularity  and  quantity  of  information  to  be  provided  for  the  purposes  of  assessment          of  ICAAP  and  ILAAP,  through  an  ongoing  supervisory  dialogue  with  an  institution  within  the          SREP.  	1
17. The competent authorities should ensure that they receive all relevant information and that     this information remains valid and applicable at the remittance	date,  even  in  cases  where  the          (production)  date  of  the  document  is  different  from  the  pertinent  reference  date.  Documents          related  to  any  information  item  specified  in  these  Guidelines  produced  in  between  the          reference  date  and  the  remittance  date  should  be  included  where  relevant  for  ICAAP  and          ILAAP  assessment  purposes  (taking  into  account  materiality  as  specified  in  these  Guidelines).        	1
18. Competent authorities may, with a view to facilitating the assessment of individual SREP     elements following the applied engagement model and supervisory examination	programme,          request  from  institutions  some  specific  information  referred  to  in  these  Guidelines  or          additional  information  outside  the  regular  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  submission  cycle  established  in          accordance  with  paragraphs  14  and  15  (e.g.  some  ILAAP-specific  information  may  be          requested  for  the  SREP  assessment  of  liquidity  and  funding  risks,  and  not  necessarily  for  the          assessment  of  ILAAP  itself).    	1
19. Where these Guidelines are applied in relation to cross-border banking groups and their     entities, and the college of supervisors has been established,	competent  authorities  involved          should,  in  the  context  of  their  cooperation  for  the  SREP  assessment  in  accordance  with          Section  11.1  of  the  SREP  Guidelines,  coordinate  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  the  dates,          means  and  format  referred  to  in  paragraph  12  as  well  as  the  exact  and  detailed  scope  of  each          information  item  consistently  for  all  group  entities.            	1
20. Where information referred to in these Guidelines is requested from institutions in the form     of the institutions’ own internal documents that do	not  follow  the  structure  or  format  set  out          in  these  Guidelines,  competent  authorities  should  endeavour  to  ensure  structural  consistency          and  comparability,  including  by  requesting  institutions  to  explain  by  means  of  ‘reader’s          manual’  how  and  where  all  information  items  specified  in  these  Guidelines  are  covered  in  the          documentation  provided.              	1
21. For the purposes of the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and calculations under     SREP, competent authorities should ensure that they have	received  all  relevant  information          items  as  specified  in  these  Guidelines,  taking  into  account  proportionality.  Where  information          items  are  already  available  to  the  competent  authorities  as  part  of  other  activities,  competent          authorities  should  require  institutions  to  confirm  in  the  ‘reader’s  manual’  that  this          information  remains  up  to  date  and  there  have  been  no  changes  to  the  pertinent  documents,          or  to  provide  updated  information  on  the  changes  made  to  the  documents  after  the  last          submission.  Based  on  these  considerations,  competent  authorities  may  decide  to  omit          information  items  that  they  possess  from  other  supervisory  activities  and  that  remain  valid          and  up  to  date  from  the  requests  for  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  information  carried  out  in  accordance          with  paragraphs  14  and  15.    	1

   14.By way of derogation from paragraph 13 a credit institution should disclose only the       information in rows 21	22  and  23  of  the  LCR  disclosure  template  in  Annex  II  where  all  of              the  following  conditions  are  met:        	1
   15.Disclosure in accordance with these guidelines should be made in accordance with the EBA       Guidelines on materiality, proprietary	and  confidentiality  and  on  disclosure  frequency              under  Articles  432(1),  432(2)  and  433  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  (EBA/GL/2014/14),              with  further  specifications  provided  in  paragraph  16  below.          	1
   16.For the purpose of point (e) of paragraph 27 of EBA/GL/2014/14, the following items       should be regarded as	items  that  are  prone  to  rapid  change:  	1
1.1.   Payment service providers should classify as major those operational or 	security incidents        that fulfil   	1
1.2.   Payment service providers should assess an operational or security incident against the        following criteria and their underlying	indicators:              	1
1.3.   Payment service providers should calculate the value of the indicator	s according to the        following methodology:  	1
        i. Transactions affected        As a general rule, payment service providers should understand	as  ‘transactions  affected’  all  domestic  and  cross-border  transactions  that  have  been  or  will  probably  be  directly  or  indirectly  affected  by  the  incident  and,  in  particular,  those  transactions  that  could  not  be  initiated  or  processed,  those  for  which  the  content  of  the  payment  message  was  altered  and  those  that  were  fraudulently  ordered  (whether  the  funds  have  been  recovered  or  not).  Furthermore,  payment  service  providers  should  understand  the  regular  level  of  payment  transactions  to  be  the  daily  annual  average  of  domestic  and  cross-border  payment  transactions  carried  out  with  the  same  payment  services  that  have  been  affected  by  the  incident,  taking  the  previous  year  as  the  reference  period  for  calculations.  If  payment  service  providers  do  not  consider  this  figure  to  be  representative  (e.g.  because  of  seasonality),  they  should  use  another,  more  representative,  metric  instead  and  convey  to  the  competent  authority  the  underlying  rationale  for  this  approach  in  the  corresponding  field  of  the  template  (see  Annex  1).    	1
1.4.   Payment service providers should assess an incident by determining, for each individual        criterion, if the relevant thresholds	in  Table  1  are  or  will  probably  be  reached  before  the  incident  is  resolved.  	1
1.5.   Payment service providers should resort to estimations if they do not have actual data to        support their	judgments  of  whether  or  not  a  given  threshold  is  or  will  probably  be  reached  before  the  incident  is  resolved  (e.g.  this  could  happen  during  the  initial  investigation  phase).  	1
1.6.   Payment service providers should carry out this assessment on a continuous basis during        the lifetime of the	incident,  to  identify  any  possible  status  change,  either  upwards  (from  non-major  to  major)  or  downwards  (from  major  to  non-major).      	1
2.1.   Payment service providers should collect all relevant information, produce an incident        report using the template provided in	Annex  1  and  submit  it  to  the  competent  authority  in  the  home  Member  State.  Payment  service  providers  should  fill  out  the  template  following  the  instructions  provided  in  Annex  1.              	1
2.2.   Payment service providers should use the same template to inform the competent        authority throughout the lifetime of	the  incident  (i.e.  for  initial,  intermediate  and  final  reports,  as  described  in  paragraphs  2.7  to  2.21).  Payment  service  providers  should  complete  the  template  in  an  incremental  manner,  on  a  best  effort  basis,  as  more  information  becomes  readily  available  in  the  course  of  their  internal  investigations.          	1
2.3.   Payment service providers should also present to the competent authority in their home        Member State, if applicable,	a  copy  of  the  information  provided  (or  that  will  be  provided)  to  their  users,  as  laid  down  in  the  second  paragraph  of  Article  96(1)  of  PSD2,  as  soon  as  it  is  available.        	1
2.4.   Payment service providers should furnish the competent authority in the home Member        State, if available and deemed	relevant  for  the  competent  authority,  with  any  additional  information  by  appending  supplementary  documentation  to  the  standardised  template  as  one  or  various  annexes.              	1
2.5.   Payment service providers should follow up on any requests from the competent authority        in the home Member	State  to  provide  additional  information  or  clarifications  regarding  already  submitted  documentation.        	1
2.6.   Payment service providers should at all times preserve the confidentiality and integrity of        the information exchanged with	the  competent  authority  in  their  home  Member  State  and  also  authenticate  themselves  properly  towards  the  competent  authority  in  their  home  Member  State.              	1
2.7.   Payment service providers should submit an initial report to the competent authority in the        home Member State	when  a  major  operational  or  security  incident  is  first  detected.          	1
2.8.   Payment service providers should send the initial report to th	e competent authority within           	1
4 hours from the moment the major operational or security incident was first detected, or,        if the reporting channels of	the  competent  authority  are  known  not  to  be  available  or  operational  at  that  time,  as  soon  as  they  become  available/operational  again.  	1
2.9.   Payment service providers should also submit an initial report to the competent authority        in the home Member	State  when  a  previously  non-major  incident  becomes  a  major  incident.  In  this  particular  case,  payment  service  providers  should  send  the  initial  report  to  the  competent  authority  immediately  after  the  change  of  status  is  identified,  or,  if  the  reporting  channels  of  the  competent  authority  are  known  not  to  be  available  or  operational  at  that  time,  as  soon  as  they  become  available/operational  again.      	1
2.10. Payment service providers should include headline-level information (i.e. section A of the       template) in their initial reports, thus featuring some	basic  characteristics  of  the  incident              and  its  expected  consequences  based  on  the  information  available  immediately  after  it  was              detected  or  reclassified.  Payment  service  providers  should  resort  to  estimations  when              actual  data  are  not  available.  Payment  service  providers  should  also  include  in  their  initial              report  the  date  for  the  next  update,  which  should  be  as  soon  as  possible  and  under  no              circumstances  go  beyond  3  business  days.      	1
2.11. Payment service providers should submit intermediate reports every time they consider       that there is a relevant status update and, as	a  minimum,  by  the  date  for  the  next  update              indicated  in  the  previous  report  (either  the  initial  report  or  the  previous  intermediate              report).  	1
2.12. Payment service providers should submit to the competent authority a first intermediate       report with a more detailed description of the	incident  and  its  consequences  (section  B  of              the  template).  Moreover,  payment  service  providers  should  produce  additional              intermediate  reports  by  updating  the  information  already  provided  in  sections  A  and  B  of              the  template  at  least,  when  they  become  aware  of  new  relevant  information  or  significant              changes  since  the  previous  notification  (e.g.  whether  the  incident  has  escalated  or              decreased,  new  causes  identified  or  actions  taken  to  fix  the  problem).  In  any  case,  payment              service  providers  should  produce  an  intermediate  report  at  the  request  of  the  competent              authority  in  the  home  Member  State.    	1
2.13. As in the case of initial reports, when actual data are not available payment service       providers should make use of	estimations.              	1
2.14. Furthermore, payment service providers should indicate in each report the date for the       next update, which should be as soon	as  possible  and  under  no  circumstances  go  beyond  3              business  days.  Should  the  payment  service  provider  not  be  able  to  comply  with  the              estimated  date  for  the  next  update,  it  should  contact  the  competent  authority  in  order  to              explain  the  reasons  behind  the  delay,  propose  a  new  plausible  submission  deadline  (no              longer  than  3  business  days)  and  send  a  new  intermediate  report  updating  exclusively  the              information  regarding  the  estimated  date  for  the  next  update.    	1
2.15. Payment service providers should send the last intermediate report when regular activities       have been recovered and business is back to	normal,  informing  the  competent  authority  of              this  circumstance.  Payment  service  providers  should  consider  that  business  is  back  to              normal  when  activity/operations  are  restored  to  the  same  level  of  service/conditions  as              defined  by  the  payment  service  provider  or  laid  out  externally  by  a  Service  Level  Agreement              (SLA)  in  terms  of  processing  times,  capacity,  security  requirements,  etc.,  and  contingency              measures  are  no  longer  in  place.            	1
2.16. Should business be back to normal before 4 hours have passed since the incident was       detected, payment service providers should	aim  to  submit  both  the  initial  and  the  last              intermediate  report  simultaneously  (i.e.  filling  out  sections  A  and  B  of  the  template)  by  the              4-hour  deadline.          	1
2.17. Payment service providers should send a final report when the root cause analysis has       taken place (regardless of whether or	not  mitigation  measures  have  already  been              implemented  or  the  final  root  cause  has  been  identified)  and  there  are  actual  figures              available  to  replace  any  estimates.            	1
2.18. Payment service providers should deliver the final report to the competent authority within       a maximum of 2 weeks after business	is  deemed  back  to  normal.  Payment  service  providers              needing  an  extension  of  this  deadline  (e.g.  if  there  are  no  actual  figures  on  the  impact              available  yet)  should  contact  the  competent  authority  before  it  has  lapsed  and  provide  an              adequate  justification  for  the  delay,  as  well  as  a  new  estimated  date  for  the  final  report.            	1
2.19. Should payment service providers be able to provide all the information required in the       final report (i.e. section C of	the  template)  within  the  4-hour  window  since  the  incident  was              detected,  they  should  aim  to  submit  in  their  initial  report  the  information  related  to  initial,              last  intermediate  and  final  reports.  	1
2.20. Payment service providers should aim to include in their f    	inal reports full information, i.e.        	1
2.21. Payment service providers should also send a final report when, as a result of the       continuous assessment of the incident,	they  identify  that  an  already  reported  incident  no              longer  fulfils  the  criteria  to  be  considered  major  and  is  not  expected  to  fulfil  them  before              the  incident  is  resolved.  In  this  case,  payment  service  providers  should  send  the  final  report              as  soon  as  this  circumstance  is  detected  and,  in  any  case,  by  the  estimated  date  for  the  next              report.  In  this  particular  situation,  instead  of  filling  out  section  C  of  the  template,  payment              service  providers  should  tick  the  box  ‘incident  reclassified  as  non-major’  and  explain  the              reasons  justifying  this  downgrading.    	1
3.1.   Where permitted by the competent authority, payment service providers wishing to        delegate reporting obligations under PSD2 to	a  third  party  should  inform  the  competent  authority  in  the  home  Member  State  and  ensure  the  fulfilment  of  the  following  conditions:  	1
3.2.   Payment service providers wishing to allow the designated third party to fulfil the reporting        obligations in a	consolidated  way  (i.e.  by  presenting  one  single  report  referred  to  several  payment  service  providers  affected  by  the  same  major  operational  or  security  incident)  should  inform  the  competent  authority  in  the  home  Member  State,  include  the  contact              	1
3.3.   Payment service providers should not delegate their reporting obligations before informing        the competent authority in the home	Member  State  or  after  having  been  informed  that  the  outsourcing  agreement  does  not  meet  the  requirements  referred  to  in  Guideline  3.1,  letter  b).            	1
3.4.   Payment service providers wishing to withdraw the delegation of their reporting obligations        should communicate this decision to	the  competent  authority  in  the  home  Member  State,  in  accordance  with  the  deadlines  and  procedures  established  by  the  latter.  Payment  service  providers  should  also  inform  the  competent  authority  in  the  home  Member  State  of  any  material  development  affecting  the  designated  third  party  and  its  ability  to  fulfil  the  reporting  obligations.              	1
3.5.   Payment service providers should materially complete their reporting obligations without        any recourse to external assistance whenever the	designated  third  party  fails  to  inform  the  competent  authority  in  the  home  Member  State  of  a  major  operational  or  security  incident  in  accordance  with  Article  96  of  PSD2  and  with  these  Guidelines.  Furthermore,  payment  service  providers  should  ensure  that  an  incident  is  not  reported  twice,  individually  by  said  payment  service  provider  and  once  again  by  the  third  party.            	1
4.1.   Payment service providers should ensure that their general operational and security policy        clearly defines all the responsibilities	for  incident  reporting  under  PSD2,  as  well  as  the  processes  implemented  to  fulfil  the  requirements  defined  in  the  present  Guidelines.    	1
5.1.   Competent authorities in the home Member State should assess the relevance of a major        operational or security	incident  to  other  domestic  authorities,  taking  as  a  basis  their  own  expert  opinion  and  using  the  following  criteria  as  primary  indicators  of  the  importance  of  said  incident:    	1
5.2.   Competent authorities in the home Member State should carry out this assessment on a        continuous basis during	the  lifetime  of  the  incident,  to  identify  any  possible  change  that  could  make  an  incident  relevant  that  was  previously  not  considered  as  such.            	1
6.1.   Notwithstanding any other legal requirement to share incident-related information with        other domestic authorities, competent authorities should provide	information  about  major  operational  or  security  incidents  to  the  domestic  authorities  identified  following  the  application  of  Guideline  5.1  (i.e.  ‘other  relevant  domestic  authorities’),  as  a  minimum,  at  the  time  of  receiving  the  initial  report  (or,  alternatively,  the  report  that  prompted  the  sharing  of  information)  and  when  they  are  notified  that  business  is  back  to  normal  (i.e.  last  intermediate  report).          	1
6.2.   Competent authorities should submit to other relevant domestic authorities the        information needed to provide a clear picture	of  what  happened  and  the  potential  consequences.  To  do  so,  they  should  provide,  as  a  minimum,  the  information  given  by  the  payment  service  provider  in  the  following  fields  of  the  template  (either  in  the  initial  or  in  the  intermediate  report):      	1
6.3.   Competent authorities should conduct proper anonymisation, as needed, and leave out any        information that could be subject	to  confidentiality  or  intellectual  property  restrictions  before  sharing  any  incident-related  information  with  other  relevant  domestic  authorities.  Nevertheless,  competent  authorities  should  provide  other  relevant  domestic  authorities  with  the  name  and  address  of  the  reporting  payment  service  provider  when  said  domestic  authorities  can  guarantee  that  the  information  will  be  treated  confidentially.  	1
6.4.   Competent authorities should at all times preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the        information stored and exchanged	with  other  relevant  domestic  authorities  and  also  authenticate  themselves  properly  towards  other  relevant  domestic  authorities.  In  particular,  competent  authorities  should  treat  all  information  received  under  these  Guidelines  in  accordance  with  the  professional  secrecy  obligations  set  out  in  PSD2,  without  prejudice  to  applicable  Union  law  and  national  requirements.      	1
7.1.   Competent authorities should always provide the EBA and the ECB with all reports received        from (or on	behalf  of)  payment  service  providers  affected  by  a  major  operational  or  security  incident  (i.e.  initial,  intermediate  and  final  reports).      	1
8.1.   Competent authorities should at all times preserve the confidentiality and integrity of the        information stored and exchanged	with  the  EBA  and  the  ECB  and  also  authenticate  themselves  properly  towards  the  EBA  and  the  ECB.  In  particular,  competent  authorities  should  treat  all  information  received  under  these  Guidelines  in  accordance  with  the  professional  secrecy  obligations  set  out  in  PSD2,  without  prejudice  to  applicable  Union  law  and  national  requirements.  	1
8.2.   To avoid delays in the transmission of incident-related information to the EBA/ECB and help        minimise the risks	of  operational  disruptions,  competent  authorities  should  support  appropriate  means  of  communication.        	1
1. All financial institutions should comply with the provisions set out in these guidelines in such a    way that is proportionate to, and takes	account  of,  the  financial  institutions’  size,  their  internal        organisation,  and  the  nature,  scope,  complexity  and  riskiness  of  the  services  and  products  that        the  financial  institutions  provide  or  intend  to  provide.              	1
2. The management body should ensure that financial institutions have adequate internal    governance and internal control framework in place for their ICT and security	risks.  The        management  body  should  set  clear  roles  and  responsibilities  for  ICT  functions,  information        security  risk  management,  and  business  continuity,  including  those  for  the  management  body        and  its  committees.          	1
3. The management body should ensure that the quantity and skills of financial institutions’ staff    is adequate to support their ICT operational needs and	their  ICT  and  security  risk  management        processes  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  their  ICT  strategy.  The        management  body  should  ensure  that  the  allocated  budget  is  appropriate  to  fulfil  the  above.        Furthermore,  financial  institutions  should  ensure  that  all  staff  members,  including  key  function        holders,  receive  appropriate  training  on  ICT  and  security  risks,  including  on  information        security,  on  an  annual  basis,  or  more  frequently  if  required  (see  also  Section  3.4.7).        	1
4. The management body has overall accountability for setting, approving and overseeing the    implementation of financial institutions’ ICT strategy as part of their overall	business  strategy        as  well  as  for  the  establishment  of  an  effective  risk  management  framework  for  ICT  and  security        risks.        	1
5. The ICT strategy should be aligned with financial institutions’   	overall business strategy and    should define:      	1
6. Financial institutions should establish sets of action plans that contain measures to be taken to    achieve the objective of the ICT strategy. These	should  be  communicated  to  all  relevant  staff        (including  contractors  and  third  party  providers  where  applicable  and  relevant).  The  action        plans  should  be  periodically  reviewed  to  ensure  their  relevance  and  appropriateness.  Financial        institutions  should  also  establish  processes  to  monitor  and  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the        implementation  of  their  ICT  strategy.      	1
7. Without prejudice to the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements (EBA/GL/2019/02) and    Article 19 of PSD2, financial institutions should ensure the effectiveness of the	risk-mitigating        measures  as  defined  by  their  risk  management  framework,  including  the  measures  set  out  in        these  guidelines,  when  operational  functions  of  payment  services  and/or  ICT  services  and  ICT        systems  of  any  activity  are  outsourced,  including  to  group  entities,  or  when  using  third  parties.          	1
8. To ensure continuity of ICT services and ICT systems, financial institutions should ensure that    contracts and service level agreements (both for normal circumstances	as  well  as  in  the  event        of  service  disruption  —  see  also  Section  3.7.2)  with  providers  (outsourcing  providers,  group        entities,  or  third  party  providers)  include  the  following:      	1
9. Financial institutions should monitor and seek assurance on the level of compliance of these    providers with the security objectives, measures and performance targets	of  the  financial        institution.  	1
10. Financial institutions should identify and manage their ICT and security risks. The ICT function(s)     in charge of ICT systems, processes and security	operations  should  have  appropriate  processes          and  controls  in  place  to  ensure  that  all  risks  are  identified,  analysed,  measured,  monitored,          managed,  reported  and  kept  within  the  limits  of  the  financial  institution’s  risk  appetite  and  that          the  projects  and  systems  they  deliver  and  the  activities  they  perform  are  in  compliance  with          external  and  internal  requirements.    	1
11. Financial institutions should assign the responsibility for managing and overseeing ICT and     security risks to a control function, adhering to the requirements	of  Section  19  of  the  EBA          Guidelines  on  internal  governance  (EBA/GL/2017/11).  Financial  institutions  should  ensure  the    	1
12. Financial institutions should define and assign key roles and responsibilities, and relevant     reporting lines, for the ICT and security risk management framework	to  be  effective.  This          framework  should  be  fully  integrated  into,  and  aligned  with,  financial  institutions’  overall  risk          management  processes.    	1
13. The ICT and security risk management framework should	 include processes in place to:             	1
14. Financial institutions should ensure that the ICT and security risk management framework is     documented, and continuously improved, based on ‘lessons learned’ during	its  implementation          and  monitoring.  The  ICT  and  security  risk  management  framework  should  be  approved  and          reviewed,  at  least  once  a  year,  by  the  management  body.      	1
15. Financial institutions should identify, establish and maintain updated mapping of their business     functions, roles and supporting processes to identify the importance of	each  and  their          interdependencies  related  to  ICT  and  security  risks.  	1
16. In addition, financial institutions should identify, establish and maintain updated mapping of     the information assets supporting their business functions and supporting processes,	such  as          ICT  systems,  staff,  contractors,  third  parties  and  dependencies  on  other  internal  and  external          systems  and  processes,  to  be  able  to,  at  least,  manage  the  information  assets  that  support  their          critical  business  functions  and  processes.    	1
17. Financial institutions should classify the identified business functions, supporting processes and     information assets referred to in paragraphs 15 and 16 in terms	of  criticality.            	1
18. To define the criticality of these identified business functions, supporting processes and     information assets, financial institutions should, at a minimum, consider the	confidentiality,          integrity  and  availability  requirements.  There  should  be  clearly  assigned  accountability  and          responsibility  for  the  information  assets.        	1
19. Financial institutions should review the adequacy of the classification of the information assets   	  and relevant documentation, when risk assessment is performed. 	1
20. Financial institutions should identify the ICT and security risks that impact the identified and     classified business functions, supporting processes and information assets,	according  to  their          criticality.  This  risk  assessment  should  be  carried  out  and  documented  annually  or  at  shorter          intervals  if  required.  Such  risk  assessments  should  also  be  performed  on  any  major  changes  in          infrastructure,  processes  or  procedures  affecting  the  business  functions,  supporting  processes          or  information  assets,  and  consequently  the  current  risk  assessment  of  financial  institutions          should  be  updated.  	1
21. Financial institutions should ensure that they continuously monitor threats and vulnerabilities     relevant to their business processes, supporting functions and information assets and	should          regularly  review  the  risk  scenarios  impacting  them.      	1
22. Based on the risk assessments, financial institutions should determine which measures are     required to mitigate identified ICT and security risks to acceptable	levels  and  whether  changes          are  necessary  to  the  existing  business  processes,  control  measures,  ICT  systems  and  ICT          services.  A  financial  institution  should  consider  the  time  required  to  implement  these  changes          and  the  time  to  take  appropriate  interim  mitigating  measures  to  minimise  ICT  and  security  risks          to  stay  within  the  financial  institution’s  ICT  and  security  risk  appetite.            	1
23. Financial institutions should define and implement measures to mitigate identified ICT and     security risks and to protect information assets in accordance with	their  classification.            	1
24. Financial institutions should report risk assessment results to the management body in a clear     and timely manner. Such reporting is without prejudice	to  the  obligation  of  PSPs  to  provide          competent  authorities  with  an  updated  and  comprehensive  risk  assessment,  as  laid  down  in          Article  95(2)  of  Directive  (EU)  2015/2366.    	1
25. A financial institution’s governance, systems and processes for its ICT and security risks should     be audited on a periodic basis by auditors	with  sufficient  knowledge,  skills  and  expertise  in  ICT          and  security  risks  and  in  payments  (for  PSPs)  to  provide  independent  assurance  of  their      	1
26. A financial institution’s management body should approve the audit plan, including any ICT     audits and any material modifications thereto. The audit plan	and  its  execution,  including  the          audit  frequency,  should  reflect  and  be  proportionate  to  the  inherent  ICT  and  security  risks  in          the  financial  institution  and  should  be  updated  regularly.              	1
27. A formal follow-up process including provisions for the timely verification and remediation	 of     critical ICT audit findings should be established.  	1
28. Financial institutions should develop and document an information security policy that should     define the high-level principles and rules to protect the confidentiality,	integrity  and  availability          of  financial  institutions’  and  their  customers’  data  and  information.  For  PSPs  this  policy  is          identified  in  the  security  policy  document  to  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  Article  5(1)(j)  of          Directive  (EU)  2015/2366.  The  information  security  policy  should  be  in  line  with  the  financial          institution’s  information  security  objectives  and  based  on  the  relevant  results  of  the  risk          assessment  process.  The  policy  should  be  approved  by  the  management  body.    	1
29. The policy should include a description of the main roles and responsibilities of information     security management, and it should set out the	requirements  for  staff  and  contractors,          processes  and  technology  in  relation  to  information  security,  recognising  that  staff  and          contractors  at  all  levels  have  responsibilities  in  ensuring  financial  institutions’  information          security.  The  policy  should  ensure  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability  of  a  financial          institution’s  critical  logical  and  physical  assets,  resources  and  sensitive  data  whether  at  rest,  in          transit  or  in  use.  The  information  security  policy  should  be  communicated  to  all  staff  and          contractors  of  the  financial  institution.              	1
30. Based on the information security policy, financial institutions should establish and implement     security measures to mitigate the ICT and security risks that	they  are  exposed  to.  These          measures  should  include:      	1
31. Financial institutions should define, document and implement procedures for logical access     control (identity and access management). These procedures should be implemented, 	      enforced,  monitored  and  periodically  reviewed.  The  procedures  should  also  include  controls          for  monitoring  anomalies.  These  procedures  should,  at  a  minimum,  implement  the  following          elements,  where  the  term  ‘user’  also  includes  technical  users:              	1
32. Electronic access by applications to data and ICT systems should be	 limited to a minimum     required to provide the relevant service. 	1
33. Financial institutions’ physical security measures should be defined, documented and     implemented to protect their premises, data centres and sensitive areas from unauthorised	        access  and  from  environmental  hazards.            	1
34. Physical access to ICT systems should be permitted to only authorised individuals. Authorisation     should be assigned in accordance with the individual’s tasks	and  responsibilities  and  limited  to          individuals  who  are  appropriately  trained  and  monitored.  Physical  access  should  be  regularly          reviewed  to  ensure  that  unnecessary  access  rights  are  promptly  revoked  when  not  required.          	1
35. Adequate measures to protect from environmental hazards should be commensurate with the     importance of the buildings and the criticality of the operations	or  ICT  systems  located  in  these          buildings.        	1
37. Furthermore, on an ongoing basis, financial institutions should determine whether changes in     the existing operational environment influence the existing security measures or	require          adoption  of  additional  measures  to  mitigate  related  risks  appropriately.  These  changes  should          be  part  of  the  financial  institutions’  formal  change  management  process,  which  should  ensure          that  changes  are  properly  planned,  tested,  documented,  authorised  and  deployed.    	1
38. Financial institutions should establish and implement policies and procedures to detect     anomalous activities that may impact financial institutions’ information security and to	respond          to  these  events  appropriately.  As  part  of  this  continuous  monitoring,  financial  institutions          	1
39. Financial institutions should establish and implement processes and organisation structures to     identify and constantly monitor security threats that could materially affect their	abilities  to          provide  services.  Financial  institutions  should  actively  monitor  technological  developments  to          ensure  that  they  are  aware  of  security  risks.  Financial  institutions  should  implement  detective          measures,  for  instance  to  identify  possible  information  leakages,  malicious  code  and  other          security  threats,  and  publicly  known  vulnerabilities  in  software  and  hardware  and  should  check          for  corresponding  new  security  updates.      	1
40. The security monitoring process should also help a financial institution to understand the     nature of operational or security incidents, to identify trends	and  to  support  the  organisation’s          investigations.          	1
41. Financial institutions should perform a variety of information security reviews, assessments and     testing to ensure the effective identification of vulnerabilities in their	ICT  systems  and  ICT          services.  For  instance,  financial  institutions  may  perform  gap  analysis  against  information          security  standards,  compliance  reviews,  internal  and  external  audits  of  the  information          systems,  or  physical  security  reviews.  Furthermore,  the  institution  should  consider  good          practices  such  as  source  code  reviews,  vulnerability  assessments,  penetration  tests  and  red          team  exercises.              	1
42. Financial institutions should establish and implement an information security testing     framework that validates the robustness and effectiveness of their information security 	      measures  and  ensure  that  this  framework  considers  threats  and  vulnerabilities,  identified          through  threat  monitoring  and  ICT  and  security  risk  assessment  process.  	1
43. The information security testing framework should        	ensure that tests:          	1
44. Financial institutions should perform ongoing and repeated tests of the security measures. For     all critical ICT systems (paragraph 17), these tests should	be  performed  at  least  on  an  annual          basis  and,  for  PSPs,  they  will  be  part  of  the  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  security  risks    	1
45. Financial institutions should ensure that tests of security measures are conducted in the event     of changes to infrastructure, processes or procedures and	if  changes  are  made  because  of          major  operational  or  security  incidents  or  due  to  the  release  of  new  or  significantly  changed          internet-facing  critical  applications.        	1
46. Financial institutions should monitor and evaluate the results of the security tests and update     their security measures accordingly without undue delays in	the  case  of  critical  ICT  systems.    	1
47. For PSPs, the testing framework should also encompass the security measures relevant to -1     payment terminals and devices used for the provision	of  payment  services,  -2  payment          terminals  and  devices  used  for  authenticating  the  payment  service  users  (PSU),  and  -3  devices          and  software  provided  by  the  PSP  to  the  PSU  to  generate/receive  an  authentication  code.    	1
48. Based on the security threats observed and the changes made, testing should be performed to     incorporate scenarios of relevant and known potential	attacks.              	1
49. Financial institutions should establish a training programme, including periodic security     awareness programmes, for all staff and contractors to ensure that they are	trained  to  perform          their  duties  and  responsibilities  consistent  with  the  relevant  security  policies  and  procedures          to  reduce  human  error,  theft,  fraud,  misuse  or  loss  and  how  to  address  information  securityrelated  risks.  Financial  institutions  should  ensure  that  the  training  programme  provides  training          for  all  staff  members  and  contractors  at  least  annually.    	1
50. Financial institutions should manage their ICT operations based on documented and     implemented processes and procedures (which, for PSPs, include the security policy	document          in  accordance  with  Article  5(1)(j)  of  PSD2)  that  are  approved  by  the  management  body.  This  set          of  documents  should  define  how  financial  institutions  operate,  monitor  and  control  their  ICT          systems  and  services,  including  the  documenting  of  critical  ICT  operations  and  should  enable          financial  institutions  to  maintain  up-to-date  ICT  asset  inventory.        	1
51. Financial institutions should ensure that performance of their ICT operations is aligned to their     business requirements. Financial institutions should maintain and improve,	when  possible,          efficiency  of  their  ICT  operations,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  need  to  consider  how  to          minimise  potential  errors  arising  from  the  execution  of  manual  tasks.              	1
52. Financial institutions should implement logging and monitoring procedures for critical ICT    	 operations to allow the detection, analysis and correction of errors. 	1
53. Financial institutions should maintain an up-to-date inventory of their ICT assets (including ICT     systems, network devices, databases, etc.). The ICT asset inventory	should  store  the          	1
    configuration of the ICT assets and the links and interdependencies between the different ICT     assets, to enable a proper	configuration  and  change  management  process.      	1
54. The ICT asset inventory should be sufficiently detailed to enable the prompt identification of an     ICT asset, its location, security classification and	ownership.  Interdependencies  between  assets          should  be  documented  to  help  in  the  response  to  security  and  operational  incidents,  including          cyber-attacks.    	1
55. Financial institutions should monitor and manage the life cycles of ICT assets, to ensure that     they continue to meet and support business	and  risk  management  requirements.  Financial          institutions  should  monitor  whether  their  ICT  assets  are  supported  by  their  external  or  internal          vendors  and  developers  and  whether  all  relevant  patches  and  upgrades  are  applied  based  on          documented  processes.  The  risks  stemming  from  outdated  or  unsupported  ICT  assets  should          be  assessed  and  mitigated.            	1
56. Financial institutions should implement performance and capacity planning and monitoring     processes to prevent, detect and respond to important performance issues of ICT	systems  and          ICT  capacity  shortages  in  a  timely  manner.    	1
57. Financial institutions should define and implement data and ICT systems backup and     restoration procedures to ensure that they can be recovered as	required.  The  scope  and          frequency  of  backups  should  be  set  out  in  line  with  business  recovery  requirements  and  the          criticality  of  the  data  and  the  ICT  systems  and  evaluated  according  to  the  performed  risk          assessment.  Testing  of  the  backup  and  restoration  procedures  should  be  undertaken  on  a          periodic  basis.            	1
58. Financial institutions should ensure that data and ICT system backups are stored securely and     are sufficiently remote from the primary site so	they  are  not  exposed  to  the  same  risks.              	1
59. Financial institutions should establish and implement an incident and problem management     process to monitor and log operational and security ICT incidents and	to  enable  financial          institutions  to  continue  or  resume,  in  a  timely  manner,  critical  business  functions  and  processes          when  disruptions  occur.  Financial  institutions  should  determine  appropriate  criteria  and          thresholds  for  classifying  events  as  operational  or  security  incidents,  as  set  out  in  the          ‘Definitions’  section  of  these  guidelines,  as  well  as  early  warning  indicators  that  should  serve  as          alerts  to  enable  early  detection  of  these  incidents.  Such  criteria  and  thresholds,  for  PSPs,  are          without  prejudice  to  the  classification  of  major  incidents  in  accordance  with  Article  96  of  PSD2          and  the  Guidelines  on  major  incident  reporting  under  PSD2  (EBA/GL/2017/10).      	1
60. To minimise the impact of adverse events and enable timely recovery, financial institutions     should establish appropriate processes and organisational structures to ensure	a  consistent  and          integrated  monitoring,  handling  and  follow-up  of  operational  and  security  incidents  and  to          make  sure  that  the  root  causes  are  identified  and  eliminated  to  prevent  the  occurrence  of          repeated  incidents.  The  incident  and  problem  management  process  should  establish:          	1
61. A financial institution should implement a programme and/or a project governance process     that defines roles, responsibilities and accountabilities to effectively support the	        implementation  of  the  ICT  strategy.            	1
62. A financial institution should appropriately monitor and mitigate risks deriving from their     portfolio of ICT projects (programme management), considering also risks that	may  result  from          interdependencies  between  different  projects  and  from  dependencies  of  multiple  projects  on          the  same  resources  and/or  expertise.    	1
63. A financial institution should establish and implement an ICT project management policy	 that     includes as a minimum:     	1
64. The ICT project management policy should ensure that information security requirements are     analysed and approved by a function that is independent from	the  development  function.          	1
65. A financial institution should ensure that all areas impacted by an ICT project are represented     in the project team and that the	project  team  has  the  knowledge  required  to  ensure  secure  and          successful  project  implementation.          	1
66. The establishment and progress of ICT projects and their associated risks should be reported to     the management body, individually or in aggregation,	depending  on  the  importance  and  size  of          the  ICT  projects,  regularly  and  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  as  appropriate.  Financial  institutions  should          include  project  risk  in  their  risk  management  framework.          	1
67. Financial institutions should develop and implement a process governing the acquisition,     development and maintenance of ICT systems. This process should be designed	using  a  riskbased  approach.        	1
68. A financial institution should ensure that, before any acquisition or development of ICT systems     takes place, the functional and non-functional requirements (including	information  security          requirements)  are  clearly  defined  and  approved  by  the  relevant  business  management.          	1
69. A financial institution should ensure that measures are in place to mitigate the risk of     unintentional alteration or intentional manipulation of the	ICT  systems  during  development          and  implementation  in  the  production  environment.  	1
70. Financial institutions should have a methodology in place for testing and approval of ICT     systems prior to their first use. This methodology	should  consider  the  criticality  of  business          processes  and  assets.  The  testing  should  ensure  that  new  ICT  systems  perform  as  intended.          They  should  also  use  test  environments  that  adequately  reflect  the  production  environment.      	1
71. Financial institutions should test ICT systems, ICT services and information security measures  	   to identify potential security weaknesses, violations and incidents.  	1
72. A financial institution should implement separate ICT environments to ensure adequate     segregation of duties and to mitigate the impact of unverified changes	to  production  systems.          Specifically,  a  financial  institution  should  ensure  the  segregation  of  production  environments          from  development,  testing  and  other  non-production  environments.  A  financial  institution          should  ensure  the  integrity  and  confidentiality  of  production  data  in  non-production          environments.  Access  to  production  data  is  restricted  to  authorised  users.      	1
73. Financial institutions should implement measures to protect the integrity of the source codes     of ICT systems that are developed in-house. They should	also  document  the  development,          implementation,  operation  and/or  configuration  of  the  ICT  systems  comprehensively  to  reduce          any  unnecessary  dependency  on  subject  matter  experts.  The  documentation  of  the  ICT  system          should  contain,  where  applicable,  at  least  user  documentation,  technical  system          documentation  and  operating  procedures.            	1
74. A financial institution’s processes for acquisition and development of ICT systems should also     apply to ICT systems developed or managed by the	business  function’s  end  users  outside  the          ICT  organisation  (e.g.  end  user  computing  applications)  using  a  risk-based  approach.  The          financial  institution  should  maintain  a  register  of  these  applications  that  support  critical          business  functions  or  processes.        	1
75. Financial institutions should establish and implement an ICT change management process to     ensure that all changes to ICT systems are recorded, tested,	assessed,  approved,  implemented          and  verified  in  a  controlled  manner.  Financial  institutions  should  handle  the  changes  during          emergencies  (i.e.  changes  that  must  be  introduced  as  soon  as  possible)  following  procedures          that  provide  adequate  safeguards.          	1
76. Financial institutions should determine whether changes in the existing operational     environment influence the existing security measures or require the adoption of additional	        measures  to  mitigate  the  risks  involved.  These  changes  should  be  in  accordance  with  the          financial  institutions’  formal  change  management  process.  	1
77. Financial institutions should establish a sound business continuity management (BCM) process     to maximise their abilities to provide services on an ongoing basis	and  to  limit  losses  in  the          event  of  severe  business  disruption  in  line  with  Article  85(2)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and          Title  VI  of  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  internal  governance  (EBA/GL/2017/11).          	1
78. As part of sound business continuity management, financial institutions should conduct     business impact analysis (BIA) by analysing their exposure to severe business	disruptions  and          assessing  their  potential  impacts  (including  on  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability),          quantitatively  and  qualitatively,  using  internal  and/or  external  data  (e.g.  third  party  provider          data  relevant  to  a  business  process  or  publicly  available  data  that  may  be  relevant  to  the  BIA)          and  scenario  analysis.  The  BIA  should  also  consider  the  criticality  of  the  identified  and  classified          business  functions,  supporting  processes,  third  parties  and  information  assets,  and  their          interdependencies,  in  accordance  with  Section  3.3.3.    	1
79. Financial institutions should ensure that their ICT systems and ICT services are designed and     aligned with their BIA, for example with redundancy	of  certain  critical  components  to  prevent          disruptions  caused  by  events  impacting  those  components.          	1
80. Based on their BIAs, financial institutions should establish plans to ensure business continuity     (business continuity plans, BCPs), which should be documented and	approved  by  their          management  bodies.  The  plans  should  specifically  consider  risks  that  could  adversely  impact          ICT  systems  and  ICT  services.  The  plans  should  support  objectives  to  protect  and,  if  necessary,          	1
    re-establish the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their business functions, supporting     processes and information assets. Financial institutions should coordinate	with  relevant          internal  and  external  stakeholders,  as  appropriate,  during  the  establishment  of  these  plans.        	1
81. Financial institutions should put BCPs in place to ensure that they can react appropriately to     potential failure scenarios and that they are	able  to  recover  the  operations  of  their  critical          business  activities  after  disruptions  within  a  recovery  time  objective  (RTO,  the  maximum  time          within  which  a  system  or  process  must  be  restored  after  an  incident)  and  a  recovery  point          objective  (RPO,  the  maximum  time  period  during  which  it  is  acceptable  for  data  to  be  lost  in          the  event  of  an  incident).  In  cases  of  severe  business  disruption  that  trigger  specific  business          continuity  plans,  financial  institutions  should  prioritise  business  continuity  actions  using  riskbased  approach,  which  can  be  based  on  the  risk  assessments  carried  out  under  Section  3.3.3.          For  PSPs  this  may  include,  for  example,  facilitating  the  further  processing  of  critical  transactions          while  remediation  efforts  continue.  	1
82. A financial institution should consider a range of different scenarios in its BCP, including     extreme but plausible ones to which it might	be  exposed,  including  a  cyber-attack  scenario,  and          it  should  assess  the  potential  impact  that  such  scenarios  might  have.  Based  on  these  scenarios,          a  financial  institution  should  describe  how  the  continuity  of  ICT  systems  and  services,  as  well  as          the  financial  institution’s  information  security,  are  ensured.              	1
83. Based on the BIAs (paragraph 78) and plausible scenarios (paragraph 82), financial institutions     should develop response and recovery plans. These plans should	specify  what  conditions  may          prompt  activation  of  the  plans  and  what  actions  should  be  taken  to  ensure  the  availability,          continuity  and  recovery  of,  at  least,  financial  institutions’  critical  ICT  systems  and  ICT  services.          The  response  and  recovery  plans  should  aim  to  meet  the  recovery  objectives  of  financial          institutions’  operations.            	1
84. The response and recovery plans should consider both short-term and	 long-term recovery     options. The plans should:      	1
85. The plans should also consider alternative options where recovery may not be feasible in the     short term because of costs, risks, logistics	or  unforeseen  circumstances.          	1
86. Furthermore, as part of the response and recovery plans, a financial institution should consider     and implement continuity measures to mitigate failures of	third  party  providers,  which  are  of          key  importance  for  a  financial  institution’s  ICT  service  continuity  (in  line  with  the  provisions  of        	1
87. Financial institutions should test their BCPs periodically. In particular, they should ensure that     the BCPs of their critical business functions, supporting processes,	information  assets  and  their          interdependencies  (including  those  provided  by  third  parties,  where  applicable)  are  tested  at          least  annually,  in  accordance  with  paragraph  89.          	1
88. BCPs should be updated at least annually, based on testing results, current threat intelligence     and lessons learned from previous events. Any changes	in  recovery  objectives  (including  RTOs          and  RPOs)  and/or  changes  in  business  functions,  supporting  processes  and  information  assets,          should  also  be  considered,  where  relevant,  as  a  basis  for  updating  the  BCPs.          	1
89. Financial institutions’ testing of their BCPs should demonstrate that they are able to sustain the     viability of their businesses until critical operations	are  re-established.  In  particular  they  should:    	1
90. Test results should be documented and any identified deficiencies resulting from the tests     should be analysed, addressed and reported to the management	body.              	1
91. In the event of a disruption or emergency, and during the implementation of the BCPs, financial     institutions should ensure that they have	effective  crisis  communication  measures  in  place  so          that  all  relevant  internal  and  external  stakeholders,  including  the  competent  authorities  when          required  by  national  regulations,  and  also  relevant  providers  (outsourcing  providers,  group          entities,  or  third  party  providers)  are  informed  in  a  timely  and  appropriate  manner.    	1
92. PSPs should establish and implement processes to enhance PSUs’ awareness of the security     risks linked to the payment services by providing PSUs	with  assistance  and  guidance.        	1
93. The assistance and guidance offered to PSUs should be updated in the light of new threats and     vulnerabilities, and changes should be	communicated  to  the  PSU.        	1
94. Where product functionality permits, PSPs should allow PSUs to disable specific payment     functionalities related to the payment services offered by the PSP	to  the  PSU.          	1
95. Where, in accordance with Article 68(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, a PSP has agreed with the     payer spending limits for payment transactions	executed  through  specific  payment          instruments,  the  PSP  should  provide  the  payer  with  the  option  to  adjust  these  limits  up  to  the          maximum  agreed  limit.        	1
96. PSPs should provide PSUs with the option to receive alerts on initiated and/or failed att empts     to initiate payment transactions, enabling them	to  detect  fraudulent  or  malicious  use  of  their          accounts.    	1
97. PSPs should keep PSUs informed about updates in security procedures	 that affect PSUs     regarding the provision of payment services.   	1
98. PSPs should provide PSUs with assistance on all questions, requests for support and     notifications of anomalies or issues regarding security matters related	to  payment  services.          PSUs  should  be  appropriately  informed  about  how  such  assistance  can  be  obtained.      	1
1.1   All PSPs should comply with all the provisions set out in these Guidelines. The level of detail should      	be  proportionate  to  the  PSP’s  size  and  to  the  nature,  scope,  complexity  and  riskiness  of  the              particular  services  that  the  PSP  provides  or  intends  to  provide.        	1
2.1   PSPs should establish an effective operational and security risk management framework (hereafter       ‘risk management framework’), which should be	approved  and  reviewed,  at  least  once  a  year,  by              the  management  body  and,  where  relevant,  by  the  senior  management.  This  framework  should              focus  on  security  measures  to  mitigate  operational  and  security  risks  and  should  be  fully  integrated              into  the  PSP’s  overall  risk  management  processes.    	1
2.2   The risk management            	 framework should:       	1
2.3   PSPs should ensure that the risk management framework is properly documented, and updated       with documented ‘lessons learned’ during	its  implementation  and  monitoring.        	1
2.4   PSPs should ensure that before a major change of infrastructure, processes or procedures and       after each major operational	or  security  incident  affecting  the  security  of  the  payment  services              they  provide,  they  review  whether  or  not  changes  or  improvements  to  the  risk  management              framework  are  needed  without  undue  delay.  	1
2.5   PSPs should establish three effective lines of defence, or an equivalent internal risk management       and control model, to	identify  and  manage  operational  and  security  risks.  PSPs  should  ensure  that              the  aforementioned  internal  control  model  has  sufficient  authority,  independence,  resources  and              direct  reporting  lines  to  the  management  body  and,  where  relevant,  to  the  senior  management.    	1
2.6   The security measures set out in these Guidelines should be audited by auditors with expertise in       IT security	and  payments  and  operationally  independent  within  or  from  the  PSP.  The  frequency              and  focus  of  such  audits  should  take  the  corresponding  security  risks  into  consideration.          	1
2.7   PSPs should ensure the effectiveness of the security measures set out in these Guidelines when       operational functions of	payment  services,  including  IT  systems,  are  outsourced.  	1
2.8   PSPs should ensure that appropriate and proportionate security objectives, measures and       performance targets are built into contracts and	service-level  agreements  with  the  providers  to              whom  they  have  outsourced  such  functions.  PSPs  should  monitor  and  seek  assurance  on  the  level              of  compliance  of  these  providers  with  the  security  objectives,  measures  and  performance  targets.        	1
3.1   PSPs should identify, establish and regularly update an inventory of their business functions, key       roles and supporting processes	in  order  to  map  the  importance  of  each  function,  role  and              supporting  processes,  and  their  interdependencies  related  to  operational  and  security  risks.  	1
3.2   PSPs should identify, establish and regularly update an inventory of the information assets, such       as ICT systems, their	configurations,  other  infrastructures  and  also  the  interconnections  with  other              internal  and  external  systems  in  order  to  be  able  to  manage  the  assets  that  support  their  critical              business  functions  and  processes.  	1
3.3   PSPs should classify the identified business functions, supporting processes	 and information assets       in terms of criticality.  	1
3.4   PSPs should ensure that they continuously monitor threats and vulnerabilities and regularly review       the risk scenarios impacting their	business  functions,  critical  processes  and  information  assets.  As              part  of  the  obligation  to  conduct  and  provide  CAs  with  an  updated  and  comprehensive  risk              assessment  of  the  operational  and  security  risks  relating  to  the  payment  services  they  provide  and              on  the  adequacy  of  the  mitigating  measures  and  control  mechanisms  implemented  in  response  to              those  risks,  as  laid  down  in  Article  95(2)  of  Directive  (EU)  2015/2366,  PSPs  should  carry  out  and              document  risk  assessments,  at  least  annually  or  at  shorter  intervals  as  determined  by  the  CA,  of              the  functions,  processes  and  information  assets  they  have  identified  and  classified  in  order  to              identify  and  assess  key  operational  and  security  risks.  Such  risk  assessments  should  also  be  done              before  any  major  change  of  infrastructure,  process  or  procedures  affecting  the  security  of              payment  services  occurs.            	1
3.5   On the basis of the risk assessments, PSPs should determine whether and to what extent changes       are necessary	to  the  existing  security  measures,  the  technologies  used  and  the  procedures  or              payment  services  offered.  PSPs  should  take  into  account  the  time  required  to  implement  the              changes  and  the  time  to  take  appropriate  interim  security  measures  to  minimise  operational  or              security  incidents,  fraud  and  potential  disruptive  effects  in  the  provision  of  payment  services.              	1
4.1    PSPs should establish and implement preventive security measures against identified operational        and security risks. These measures	should  ensure  an  adequate  level  of  security  in  accordance  with  the  risks  identified.    	1
4.2    PSPs should establish and implement a ‘defence-in-depth’ approach by instituting multi-layered        controls covering people, processes and	technology,  with  each  layer  serving  as  a  safety  net  for  preceding  layers.  Defence-in-depth  should  be  understood  as  having  defined  more  than  one  control  covering  the  same  risk,  such  as  the  four-eyes  principle,  two-factor  authentication,  network  segmentation  and  multiple  firewalls.        	1
4.3    PSPs should ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their critical logical and physical        assets, resources	and  sensitive  payment  data  of  their  PSUs  whether  at  rest,  in  transit  or  in  use.  If  the  data  include  personal  data,  such  measures  should  be  implemented  in  compliance  with  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  9  or,  if  applicable,  Regulation  (EC)  45/2001.  10      	1
4.4    On an on-going basis, PSPs should determine whether changes in the existing operational        environment influence the	existing  security  measures  or  require  the  adoption  of  further  measures  to  mitigate  the  risk  involved.  These  changes  should  be  part  of  the  PSP’s  formal  change  management  process,  which  should  ensure  that  changes  are  properly  planned,  tested,  documented  and  authorised.  On  the  basis  of  the  security  threats  observed  and  the  changes  made,  testing  should  be  performed  to  incorporate  scenarios  of  relevant  and  known  potential  attacks.              	1
4.5    In designing, developing and providing payment services, PSPs should ensure that segregation of        duties and ‘least	privilege’  principles  are  applied.  PSPs  should  pay  special  attention  to  the  segregation  of  IT  environments,  in  particular  to  the  development,  testing  and  production  environments.          	1
4.6    In designing, developing and providing payment services, PSPs should ensure that the collection,        routing, processing, storing	and/or  archiving  and  visualisation  of  sensitive  payment  data  of  the  PSU  is  adequate,  relevant  and  limited  to  what  is  necessary  for  the  provision  of  its  payment  services.    	1
4.7    PSPs should regularly check that the software used for the provision of payment services, including        the	users’  payment-related  software,  is  up  to  date  and  that  critical  security  patches  are  deployed.  PSPs  should  ensure  that  integrity-checking  mechanisms  are  in  place  in  order  to  verify  the  integrity  of  software,  firmware  and  information  on  their  payment  services.          	1
4.8   PSPs should have appropriate physical security measures in place, in particular to protect the       sensitive payment data of	the  PSUs  as  well  as  the  ICT  systems  used  to  provide  payment  services.    	1
4.9   Physical and logical access to ICT systems should be permitted only for authorised individuals.       Authorisation should be assigned	in  accordance  with  the  staff’s  tasks  and  responsibilities,  limited              to  individuals  who  are  appropriately  trained  and  monitored.  PSPs  should  institute  controls  that              reliably  restrict  such  access  to  ICT  systems  to  those  with  a  legitimate  business  requirement.              Electronic  access  by  applications  to  data  and  systems  should  be  limited  to  the  minimum  that  is              required  to  provide  the  relevant  service.      	1
4.10 PSPs should institute strong controls over privileged system access by strictly limiting and closely      supervising staff with elevated system access entitlements.	Controls  such  as  roles-based  access,            logging  and  reviewing  of  the  systems  activities  of  privileged  users,  strong  authentication  and            monitoring  for  anomalies  should  be  implemented.  PSPs  should  manage  access  rights  to            information  assets  and  their  supporting  systems  on  a  ‘need-to-know’  basis.  Access  rights  should            be  periodically  reviewed.          	1
4.11 Access logs should be retained for a period commensurate with the criticality of the identified      business functions, supporting processes and information	assets,  in  accordance  with  GL  3.1  and            GL  3.2,  without  prejudice  to  the  retention  requirements  set  out  in  EU  and  national  law.  PSPs            should  use  this  information  to  facilitate  identification  and  investigation  of  anomalous  activities            that  have  been  detected  in  the  provision  of  payment  services.        	1
4.12 In order to ensure secure communication and reduce risk, remote administrative access to critical      ICT components should be granted only on	a  need-to-know  basis  and  when  strong  authentication            solutions  are  used.              	1
4.13 The operation of products, tools and procedures related to access control processes should      protect the access control processes from being compromised	or  circumvented.  This  includes            enrolment,  delivery,  revocation  and  withdrawal  of  corresponding  products,  tools  and  procedures.    	1
5.1   PSPs should establish and implement processes and capabilities to continuously monitor business       functions, supporting processes and information assets	in  order  to  detect  anomalous  activities  in              the  provision  of  payment  services.  As  part  of  this  continuous  monitoring,  PSPs  should  have  in  place              appropriate  and  effective  capabilities  for  detecting  physical  or  logical  intrusion  as  well  as  breaches              of  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability  of  the  information  assets  used  in  the  provision  of              payment  services.  	1
5.2   The continuous monitoring and detection        	processes should cover:         	1
5.3   PSPs should implement detective measures to identify possible information leakages, malicious       code and other security threats, and publicly	known  vulnerabilities  for  software  and  hardware,              and  check  for  corresponding  new  security  updates.      	1
5.4   PSPs should determine appropriate criteria and thresholds for classifying an event as an       operational or security incident, as	set  out  in  the  ‘Definitions’  section  of  these  Guidelines,  as  well              as  early  warning  indicators  that  should  serve  as  an  alert  for  the  PSP  to  enable  early  detection  of              operational  or  security  incidents.          	1
5.5   PSPs should establish appropriate processes and organisational structures to ensure the consistent       and integrated monitoring, handling and follow-up	of  operational  or  security  incidents.      	1
5.6   PSPs should establish a procedure for reporting such operational or security incidents as well as       security-related customer complaints	to  its  senior  management.        	1
6.1   PSPs should establish sound business continuity management to maximise their ability to provide       payment services on an on-going	basis  and  to  limit  losses  in  the  event  of  severe  business              disruption.        	1
6.2   In order to establish sound business continuity management, PSPs should carefully analyse their       exposure to severe business disruptions	and  assess,  quantitatively  and  qualitatively,  their              potential  impact,  using  internal  and/or  external  data  and  scenario  analysis.  On  the  basis  of  the              identified  and  classified  critical  functions,  processes,  systems,  transactions  and  interdependencies              in  accordance  with  GL  3.1  to  GL  3.3,  PSPs  should  prioritise  business  continuity  actions  using  a  riskbased  approach,  which  can  be  based  on  the  risk  assessments  carried  out  under  GL  3.  Depending              on  the  business  model  of  the  PSP,  this  may,  for  example,  facilitate  the  further  processing  of  critical              transactions  while  remediation  efforts  continue.          	1
6.3   On the basis of the analysis carried out under GL 6.2,    	 a PSP should put in place:   	1
6.4   The PSP should consider a range of different scenarios, including extreme but plausible ones, to       which it might	be  exposed,  and  assess  the  potential  impact  such  scenarios  might  have.        	1
6.5   Based on the analysis carried out under GL 6.2 and plausible scenarios identified under GL 6.4, the       PSP	should  develop  response  and  recovery  plans,  which  should:              	1
6.6   PSPs should test their BCPs, and ensure that the operation of their critical functions, processes,       systems, transactions and	interdependencies  are  tested  at  least  annually.  The  plans  should              support  objectives  to  protect  and,  if  necessary,  re-establish  the  integrity  and  availability  of  their              operations,  and  the  confidentiality  of  their  information  assets.              	1
6.7   Plans should be updated at least annually, based on testing results, current threat intelligence,       information-sharing and lessons learned	from  previous  events,  and  changing  recovery  objectives,              as  well  as  analysis  of  operationally  and  technically  plausible  scenarios  that  have  not  yet  occurred,              and,  if  relevant,  after  changes  in  systems  and  processes.  PSPs  should  consult  and  coordinate  with              relevant  internal  and  external  stakeholders  during  the  establishment  of  their  BCPs.          	1
6.8   PSPs’ testing of           	their BCPs should:        	1
6.9   PSPs should periodically monitor the effectiveness of their BCPs, and document and analyse any       challenges or failures resulting	from  the  tests.          	1
6.10 In the event of a disruption or emergency, and during the implementation of the BCPs, PSPs should      ensure that they have	effective  crisis  communication  measures  in  place  so  that  all  relevant  internal            and  external  stakeholders,  including  external  service  providers,  are  informed  in  a  timely  and            appropriate  manner.              	1
7.1   PSPs should establish and implement a testing framework that validates the robustness and       effectiveness of the security measures	and  ensure  that  the  testing  framework  is  adapted  to              consider  new  threats  and  vulnerabilities,  identified  through  risk-monitoring  activities.          	1
7.2   PSPs should ensure that tests are conducted in the event of changes to infrastructure, processes       or procedures and	if  changes  are  made  as  a  consequence  of  major  operational  or  security              incidents.      	1
7.3   The testing framework should also encompass the security measures relevant to (i) payment       terminals and devices used for	the  provision  of  payment  services,  (ii)  payment  terminals  and              devices  used  for  authenticating  the  PSU  and  (iii)  devices  and  software  provided  by  the  PSP  to  the              PSU  to  generate/receive  an  authentication  code.            	1
7.4   The testing framework               	should ensure that tests:   	1
7.5   PSPs should perform on-going and repeated tests of the security measures for their payment       services. For systems that	are  critical  for  the  provision  of  their  payment  services  (as  described  in              GL  3.2),  these  tests  shall  be  performed  at  least  on  an  annual  basis.  Non-critical  systems  should  be              tested  regularly  on  a  risk-based  approach,  but  at  least  every  three  years.        	1
7.6   PSPs should monitor and evaluate the results of the tests conducted, and update their security       measures accordingly and	without  undue  delay  in  the  case  of  critical  systems.            	1
8.1   PSPs should establish and implement processes and organisational structures to identify and       constantly monitor security and operational threats	that  could  materially  affect  their  ability  to              provide  payment  services.            	1
8.2   PSPs should analyse operational or security incidents that have been identified or have occurred       within and/or outside the	organisation.  PSPs  should  consider  key  lessons  learned  from  these              analyses  and  update  the  security  measures  accordingly.              	1
8.3   PSPs should actively monitor technological developments to ensure  	that they are aware of security       risks.  	1
8.4   PSPs should establish a training programme for all staff to ensure that they are trained to perform       their	duties  and  responsibilities  consistent  with  the  relevant  security  policies  and  procedures  in              order  to  reduce  human  error,  theft,  fraud,  misuse  or  loss.  PSPs  should  ensure  that  the  training              programme  provides  for  training  staff  members  at  least  annually,  and  more  frequently  if  required.      	1
8.5   PSPs should ensure that staff members occupying key roles identified under GL 3.1 receive       targeted information security training	on  an  annual  basis,  or  more  frequently  if  required.            	1
8.6   PSPs should establish and implement periodic security awareness programmes in order to educate       their personnel and to address	information  security  related  risks.  These  programmes  should              require  PSP  personnel  to  report  any  unusual  activity  and  incidents.            	1
9.1   PSPs should establish and implement processes to enhance PSUs’ awareness of security risks       linked to the payment services	by  providing  PSUs  with  assistance  and  guidance.  	1
9.2   The assistance and guidance offered to PSUs should be updated in the light of new threats and       vulnerabilities,	and  changes  should  be  communicated  to  the  PSU.              	1
9.3   Where product functionality permits, PSPs should allow PSUs to disable specific payment       functionalities related to the payment services	offered  by  the  PSP  to  the  PSU.  	1
9.4   Where, in accordance with Article 68(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, a PSP has agreed with the       payer spending	limits  for  payment  transactions  executed  through  specific  payment  instruments,              the  PSP  should  provide  the  payer  with  the  option  to  adjust  these  limits  up  to  the  maximum  agreed              limit.      	1
9.5   PSPs should provide PSUs with the option to receive alerts on initiated and/or failed attempts to       initiate payment	transactions,  enabling  them  to  detect  fraudulent  or  malicious  use  of  their              account.        	1
9.6   PSPs should keep PSUs informed about updates in security procedures which affect PSUs regarding       the provision of payment	services.              	1
9.7   PSPs should provide PSUs with assistance on all questions, requests for support and notifications       of anomalies or issues	regarding  security  matters  related  to  payment  services.  PSUs  should  be              appropriately  informed  about  how  such  assistance  can  be  obtained.        	1
9. Where dissenting views arise among competent authorities on issues relating to these    guidelines, those authorities should endeavour to file with the EBA a	request  as  referred  to  in        Article  31(c)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1093/2010.  Where  a  request  has  been  filed,  all  the        competent  authorities  involved  should  provide  adequate  information  to  the  EBA,  including        arguments  supporting  their  distinct  views,  to  enable  the  EBA  to  form  an  opinion  on  the  disputed        issues;  all  the  competent  authorities  involved  should  subsequently  endeavour  to  take  into        account  the  EBA’s  opinion.              	1
10. Competent authorities should assess and determine, in accordance with the process and     criteria specified in this section, whether a branch that has	been  designated  significant  in          accordance  with  Article  51  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  also  satisfies  the  intensification  test.    	1
11. Where, in a college of supervisors referred to in Article 116 of Directive 2013/36/EU, the     consolidating supervisor and the home competent authority	of  a  given  branch  are  different,          they  should  work  in  close  cooperation  on  the  basis  of  Section  5.8  to  ensure  that  the  branch  is          supervised  in  accordance  with  these  guidelines.          	1
12. Without prejudice to the stipulations of Article 51 of Directive 2013/36/EU, the consolidating     supervisor or the home competent authority should, in the	context  of  the  mapping  of  the          institution  or  the  group  performed  in  accordance  with  Articles  2  and  23  of  Commission          Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/98  and  Articles  2  and  17  of  Commission  Implementing          Regulation  (EU)  2016/99,  conduct  its  own  assessment  of  the  importance  of  a  given  branch  for          that  particular  institution  or  group  on  the  basis  of  the  criteria  referred  to  in  paragraphs  28-31.            	1
13. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should note its assessment of     the branch’s importance to the institution or the group	in  the  relevant  field  of  the  mapping          template  referred  to  in  Articles  2  and  17  and  Annex  I  of  Commission  Implementing          Regulation  (EU)  2016/99.        	1
14. Where the consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority has, on the basis of its     assessment, determined that a branch is important	for  the  institution  or  the  group,  it  should          communicate  its  view  to  the  host  competent  authority,  independently  or  in  the  process  of          finalising  the  mapping  of  the  institution  or  the  group  in  accordance  with  Article  2  of          Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2016/99,  and  invite  that  authority  to  consider          applying  the  process  referred  to  in  Article  51  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  to  determine  the  branch          to  be  significant.            	1
15. Where the consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority has communicated to     the host competent authority that it considers the branch important	for  the  institution  or  for          the  group,  the  host  competent  authority  should  consider  whether  to  apply  the  process  set  out          in  Article  51  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  provide,  either  independently  or  in  the  context  of  its          views  or  comments  on  the  mapping  of  the  institution  or  the  group  referred  to  in  Article  2  of          	1
16. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should assess the importance     for the institution or the group of a given branch	on  a  periodic  basis  and  at  least  during  every          update  of  the  mapping  of  the  institution  or  the  group  referred  to  in  Article  2  of  Commission          Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2016/99.  The  host  competent  authority  should  ensure          continuous  monitoring  of  the  conditions  set  out  in  Article  51  of  Directive  2013/36/EC  for          branches  established  within  its  supervisory  remit.            	1
17. Where the consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority considers the branch     important for the institution or the group, but the host	competent  authority  does  not  deem  it          significant  within  the  meaning  of  Article  51  of  Directive  2013/36/EC,  the  consolidating          supervisor  or  the  home  competent  authority  should  nevertheless  invite  the  host  competent          authority  to  participate  in  the  college  of  supervisors  in  accordance  with  Article  3(2)  of          Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/98  and  Article  3(1)(b)  of  Commission          Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2016/99.              	1
18. After the branch has been designated significant in accordance with Article 51 of     Directive 2013/36/EU, the consolidating supervisor and the home competent	authority  should,          without  undue  delay,  update  the  mapping  of  the  institution  or  the  group.  In  particular,  it  should          be  noted  in  the  mapping  of  the  institution  or  the  group  whether  the  host  competent  authority          participates  in  the  relevant  college  as  a  member  (significant  branch)  or  as  an  observer  (nonsignificant  branch),  as  provided  for  in  Article  4  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation          (EU)  2016/98,  and  the  list  of  the  college’s  members  and  observers  should  be  updated          accordingly.        	1
19. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should cooperate     on the basis of the following paragraphs and endeavour to	make  a  common  assessment  and          arrive  at  a  common  conclusion  on  whether  a  branch  that  has  been  determined  to  be  significant          in  accordance  with  Article  51  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  also  satisfies  the  intensification  test  and          should  therefore  be  deemed  a  ‘significant-plus’  branch  for  the  purposes  of  these  guidelines  and          be  subject  to  the  intensified  supervision  referred  to  in  Section  5.  This  common  conclusion          should  be  communicated  to  the  institution  and  the  EU  parent  institution  by  the  consolidating          supervisor  and  the  home  competent  authority.            	1
20. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should agree on     the timeline and the process for the performance of	the  intensification  test,  and  on  the          preparation  of  the  common  conclusion  on  whether  this  test  is  satisfied.  	1
21. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should endeavour     to perform their common assessment of whether the conditions of	the  intensification  test  are          satisfied  making  use  of  information  already  available  from  COREP  and  FINREP,  as  well  as  other          information  already  collected  from  the  institution,  including  from  the  institution’s  or  the          group’s  ICAAP  or  ILAAP.  For  that  purpose  and  without  prejudice  to  Article  28  of  Commission          Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/98,  the  consolidating  supervisor  and  the  home  and  host          competent  authorities  should  also  exchange  within  the  college  framework  any  further          information  necessary.        	1
22. Where dissenting views on the outcome of the intensification test arise among the authorities     and a common conclusion is prevented, the authorities	should  file  with  the  EBA  a  request  as          referred  to  in  Article  31(c)  of  the  EBA  Regulation  along  with  all  information  necessary  for  the          EBA  to  form  an  opinion  on  the  disputed  issues  and  assist  the  authorities  in  coming  to  a  common          conclusion.  All  the  competent  authorities  involved  should  take  into  account  the  EBA’s  opinion          and  settle  the  issue  accordingly.    	1
23. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should ensure that a branch     that satisfies the intensification test is duly noted in	the  mapping  of  the  institution  or  the  group          and  that  information  is  communicated  to  the  supervisory  college  as  appropriate.            	1
24. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should review their     common conclusion on the outcome of the intensification test	at  least  annually  and  update  it.          For  the  review  and  the  update,  paragraphs  20-23  and  Section  4.2.2  apply.              	1
25. Competent authorities should ensure that a branch no longer satisfying the intensification test     remains a significant branch for the purposes of Article	51  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  unless          reassessed  otherwise  under  the  provisions  of  that  Article,  as  the  assessment  procedures  remain          separate.    	1
26. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should perform the     intensification test having regard to the size, scope, nature	and  systemic  importance  of  the          branch’s  activities  in  the  host  Member  State  and  to  its  significance  for  the  institution  or  the          group.            	1
27. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should consider     that a significant branch should be further assessed only if	that  branch  is  providing  critical          functions  within  the  meaning  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  on  the  basis  of  information  from  the          (group)  recovery  or  the  (group)  resolution  plan,  in  the  following  areas:          	1
28. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should consider     whether a significant branch that provides critical functions also satisfies	the  following          conditions:  	1
29. A significant branch providing critical functions should be considered important for the     institution or for the group where the branch meets one	or  more  of  the  conditions  referred  to          in  Article  7(2)(a)-(e)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/1075  either  for  the          institution  or  for  the  group.        	1
30. Competent authorities should also consider a significant branch important for the institution     or the group where, on the basis of any information	submitted  by  the  institution  or  the  EU          parent  undertaking  including  for  the  purposes  of  the  ICAAP,  ILAAP,  recovery  plan  or  any  other          planning,  the  branch  has  been  referred  to  as  being  important,  either  for  the  institution  or  for          the  group.          	1
31. For the purposes of the assessment of whether a significant branch providing critical functions     should be considered of significant importance to the	financial  stability  of  the  host  Member          State,  competent  authorities  should  consider  if  the  branch  meets  any  of  the  following  criteria:          	1
32. The ongoing supervision of branches that satisfy the intensification test (significant-plus     branches) should be organised and performed in accordance with the tasks	and  responsibilities          of  the  consolidating  supervisor  and  the  home  and  host  competent  authorities  referred  to  in          Directives  2013/36/EU  and  in  Directive  2014/59/EU  and  having  regard  to  Sections  5.1  to  5.8  of          these  guidelines.          	1
33. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should endeavour     to ensure that the operational context of the college fully	enables  the  supervision  of  the          significant-plus  branches  in  accordance  with  these  guidelines.            	1
34. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should ensure that     the significant-plus branch is subject to effective and efficient	supervisory  assessment  under          the  supervisory  review  and  evaluation  process  (SREP)  applied  to  the  institutions  and  the  group          in  accordance  with  Article  97  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  the  EBA’s  Guidelines  on  common          procedures  and  methodologies  for  SREP  12.  In  particular,  the  consolidating  supervisor  or  the          home  competent  authority  should  ensure  that  the  group  risk  assessment  or  the  SREP  report  of          an  institution  referred  to  in  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  710/2014  includes          a  distinct  and  noticeable  reference  to  the  supervisory  assessment  of  any  significant-plus          branch,  including  an  assessment  of  the  material  risks  that  the  branch  is  or  might  be  exposed  to,          the  branch’s  business  model  and  strategy,  and  the  risks  that  the  branch  poses  to  the  financial          system  in  the  host  Member  State  (the  branch  risk  assessment).              	1
35. This branch risk assessment should be included as an annex to the group risk assessment report     or the SREP report for the	institution.              	1
36. Institutions or significant-plus branches should not be required to prepare branch-specific     ICAAP or ILAAP information. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent	authority          should  ensure  that  the  institution’s  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  information  collected  in  accordance  with          the  EBA’s  Guidelines  on  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  information  collected  for  SREP  purposes  13  duly  covers          significant-plus  branches  and  adequately  reflects  their  risks  exposures,  as  well  as  the  capital          and  liquidity  allocated  to  cover  those  risks.  For  that  purpose,  the  consolidating  supervisor  or          the  home  competent  authority  should  ensure  that  an  institution  a  branch  of  which  has  satisfied  	1
37. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should ensure that the branch     risk assessment captures the assessment of all SREP elements	that  are  relevant  to  the  branch.          For  that  purpose,  the  branch  risk  assessment  should  not  include  an  assessment  of  capital          adequacy,  as  this  is  not  relevant  at  branch  level;  however,  the  assessment  should  include  an          assessment  of  the  appropriateness  of  internal  capital  and  liquidity  allocation  to  the  risk          exposures  taken  by  the  institution  through  the  significant-plus  branch  prepared  on  the  basis  of          the  group’s  or  the  institution’s  ICAAP  and  ILAAP  information,  as  this  may  be  deemed  relevant          to  the  branch.  At  a  minimum,  the  branch  risk  assessment  should  include  the  outcomes  of  an          assessment  of  the  following  elements:  	1
38. In addition to the above, the branch risk assessment should provide an overview of any findings     of on-site inspections and on-the-spot checks	performed  by  the  competent  authority  of  the          home  or  host  Member  State  relevant  to  the  risk  assessment  of  the  institution  or  the  financial          system  in  the  host  Member  State.            	1
39. In preparing the branch risk assessment, the consolidating supervisor or the home competent     authority should ensure that it has obtained and duly	considered  appropriate  input  from  the          host  competent  authority.  The  host  competent  authority  should,  at  a  minimum,  provide  the          following  input:  	1
40. The host competent authority should provide the input specified in the above paragraph based     on the information that it has available, including	from:              	1
41. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should coordinate     the timing of the development of the branch risk assessment	to  reflect  the  timing  of  the          preparation  of  the  group  risk  assessment  or  the  SREP  reports  (i.e.  the  SREP  cycle).  Where          relevant,  such  coordination  should  be  performed  within  the  framework  of  the  college  of          supervisors  and  be  reflected  in  the  college  supervisory  examination  programme  (college  SEP)          and  timetable  for  reaching  a  joint  decision  on  institution-specific  prudential  requirements  in          accordance  with  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  710/2014.            	1
42. The college SEP referred to in Article 11 and Article 20 of Commission Implementing     Regulation (EU) 2016/99 should, in the case of	a  significant-plus  branch,  take  into  account  the          outcome  of  that  branch’s  risk  assessment  performed  in  accordance  with  Section  5.1.            	1
43. Where the branch risk assessment has identified significant risks to capital, liquidity and funding     that the branch is or might be exposed	to,  and/or  risks  to  the  viability  of  the  institution          stemming  from  the  branch,  including  from  the  branch’s  governance  and  risk  controls,  the          conclusions  of  the  assessment  should  inform  the  supervisory  activities  planned  by  the          consolidating  supervisor  and  the  home  and  host  authorities  to  be  noted  in  the  college  SEP.      	1
44. While developing the college SEP, the consolidating supervisor and the home and host     competent authorities should discuss the allocation of work and	division  of  tasks  for  the          performance  of  the  planned  supervisory  activities  concerning  the  significant-plus  branch  and          they  should  explore  the  opportunities  for  some  of  these  activities  to  be  performed  jointly  by          the  home  and  host  competent  authorities.  	1
45. In order to avoid duplication of supervisory tasks and duplication of information requests to     the supervised institution concerning the significant-plus branch, the	home  and  host          competent  authorities  should  consider  when  developing  the  college  SEP  the  appropriate          allocation  of  tasks,  as  specified  in  Section  5.8.            	1
46. Without prejudice to Article 52 of Directive 2013/36/EU, on-the-spot checks and inspections of     branches, to the extent that they are planned in	advance,  should  be  included  in  the  college  SEP          developed  in  accordance  with  Articles  16  and  31  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation          (EU)  2016/98.            	1
47. In order to ensure that the consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent     authorities have an overview of planned on-the-spot checks	and  inspections  of  branches,  even          those  that  are  not  performed  on  a  joint  basis,  and  to  avoid  unnecessary  duplication  of          supervisory  efforts  and  requests  to  institutions,  the  college  SEP  should,  as  far  as  practicable,          include  information  on  all  such  activities  organised  by  either  the  home  or  the  host  competent          authority,  and  their  scope,  timing  and  planned  resources.          	1
48. When the consolidating supervisor or the home or host competent authority decides on the     timing of jointly performed activities, the authority initiating	and  organising  the  activities          should  take  due  consideration  of  the  participating  authorities’  needs  in  terms  of  resources  and          supervisory  cycles,  and  in  particular  the  SREP  cycle.    	1
49. On-the-spot checks and inspections in a branch that have not been originally planned but are     initiated during the year should be communicated	from  one  authority  to  the  other  without          undue  delay,  and  duly  reflected  in  the  updated  college  SEP.  	1
50. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should ensure that     the number of on-the-spot checks and inspections for significant-plus	branches  on  a  yearly          basis  is  higher  than  for  other  types  of  branches.          	1
51. A competent authority initiating an on-the-spot check or inspection (the initiator) in a 	    significant-plus branch should apply the following process:  	1
52. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should invite the host     competent authority to participate in on-the-spot checks or inspections carried	out  at  an          institution  when  such  activities  are  relevant  to  significant-plus  branches  (in  particular,  this          should  include  meetings  with  the  group’s  or  the  institution’s  management  on  issues  concerning          such  branches;  see  also  Section  5.6).        	1
53. Without prejudice to the provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 524/2014     and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 620/2014, the consolidating supervisor	and          the  home  and  host  competent  authorities  involved  in  the  supervision  of  significant-plus          branches  should  ensure  that  they  share,  by  means  of  making  available  on  their  own  initiative          or  upon  request,  all  the  information  pertaining  to  the  group,  the  institution  or  the  branch  that          is  adequate,  accurate  and  relevant  for  the  branch’s  effective  and  efficient  supervision  as  set          out  in  these  guidelines.      	1
54. When assessing the relevance of a particular piece or set of information, the consolidating     supervisor and the home and host competent authorities	should,  in  a  proportionate  manner          and  on  a  risk  basis,  endeavour  to  anticipate  the  impact  of  such  information  on  the  following:        	1
55. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should, without     prejudice to the provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No	524/2014  and          Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  620/2014,  ensure  that  they  share  at  least,  in  a          proportionate  and  appropriate  manner,  adequate  information  on  the  following  items:    	1
56. Such information should be exchanged in a timely manner and in written or electronic form, as     far as possible making use of	secure  means  of  communication,  aiming  to  facilitate  the          performance  of  the  relevant  supervisory  tasks  in  an  efficient  and  effective  way.          	1
57. In liquidity stress situations, the competent authorities should notify each other in accordance     with the requirements of Article 17 of Commission Delegated	Regulation  (EU)  No  524/2014  and          following  the  procedure  set  out  in  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  No  620/2014,          and,  in  providing  the  information  specified  in  Article  17(3)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation          (EU)  No  524/2014,  should  explain  the  expected  impact  of  the  stress  on  the  liquidity  of  the          institution  and  provide  the  latest  available  liquidity  ratios  in  the  domestic  currency  of  the          institution’s  home  Member  State  and  in  all  other  currencies  that  are  material  for  the  institution.        	1
58. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should apply supervisory     measures as provided for in Articles 104 and 105 of Directive	2013/36/EU  to  the  institution          based  on  the  SREP  findings  and  the  specific  findings  of  the  branch  risk  assessment  when          measures  are  applied  in  relation  to  the  risks  taken  by  the  institution  through  a  significant-plus          branch  or  deficiencies  identified  in  such  a  branch.      	1
59. Without prejudice to Article 41 of Directive 2013/36/EU, the consolidating supervisor and the     home and host competent authorities should coordinate the application	of  supervisory          measures  and  precautionary  measures  taken  in  relation  to  the  significant-plus  branch,  within          the  framework  of  colleges  of  supervisors,  considering  in  particular  the  following:      	1
60. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should regularly     inform each other about any macroprudential measures, or any other	measures  applied  to          institutions  or  branches  for  the  purpose  of  safeguarding  financial  stability,  that  might  be          relevant  to  the  institution  or  the  significant-plus  branch.        	1
61. The consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should consider the information     regarding macroprudential measures received in accordance with the previous paragraph	for          the  purpose  of  deciding  whether  to  extend  the  measures  to  the  entire  institution  under  the          provisions  on  voluntary  reciprocity  for  macroprudential  measures  set  out  by  the  European          Systemic  Risk  Board  (ESRB)  14.          	1
62. When deciding on reciprocating macroprudential measures applied in a host Member State to     an institution operating through a branch, the consolidating supervisor	or  the  home  competent          authority  should  also  consider  the  following:  	1
63. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should strive to     ensure that the messages communicated to the institution or	the  group  concerning  the  branch          are  consistent.  To  this  end,  the  consolidating  supervisor  and  the  home  and  host  authorities          should  ensure  that  they  have  consulted  each  other  before  issuing  any  form  of  formal          communication  to  the  group  or  institution  pertaining  to  the  branch.    	1
64. When communicating with the significant-plus branch, and in particular requesting information     needed for the performance of its tasks in accordance with the	applicable  legislation,  including          these  guidelines,  the  host  competent  authority  should  duly  inform  and  coordinate  with  the          consolidating  supervisor  or  the  home  competent  authority.          	1
65. At a minimum, the consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities     should organise a joint annual meeting with the branch	management,  where  possible  attended          also  by  the  representatives  of  the  senior  management  of  the  institution,  to  discuss  the          following:    	1
66. If either the consolidating supervisor or the home or host competent authority is not able to     participate in this joint meeting, the	relevant  authorities  should  inform  the  others  accordingly,          and  the  authorities  should  share  the  conclusions  of  the  meeting  and  discuss  any  follow-up          actions.            	1
67. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should agree on     the form and frequency of joint meetings with the	senior  management  of  the  institution  to          discuss  issues  more  specifically  relevant  to  the  significant-plus  branch  or  issues  that  may          potentially  affect  the  branch.          	1
68. These joint meetings with the institution and with the branch management should be duly     reflected	 in the college SEP.   	1
69. Within the process for the assessment of the recovery plan in accordance with Article 6(2) of     Directive 2014/59/EU or the process for	the  assessment  of  the  group  recovery  plan  in          accordance  with  Article  8(1)  of  that  Directive,  and  also  considering  the  requirements  of  the          EBA’s  Recommendation  on  the  coverage  of  entities  in  the  group  recovery  plan  16  ,  the          consolidating  supervisor  or  the  home  competent  authority  should  consult  with  the  host          competent  authority  of  significant  branches  in  accordance  with  Articles  6(2)  and  8(1)  of          Directive  2014/59/EU.  	1
70. To facilitate this consultation, the consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority     should share the group recovery plan or the institution’s plan,	respectively,  with  the  host          competent  authority  in  accordance  with  the  timeline  established  in  the  college  of  supervisors          for  the  assessment  of  the  recovery  plan  and  a  joint  decision  on  the  assessment  of  the  group          recovery  plan.  Furthermore,  the  consolidating  supervisor  or  the  home  competent  authority          should  seek  input  from  the  host  competent  authority  of  the  significant-plus  branch  to  facilitate          the  assessment  of  the  group  recovery  plan  or  institution’s  recovery  plan.    	1
71. The host competent authority should provide its input to the assessment of the group recovery     plan or institution’s recovery plan within the	timeline  established  by  the  college  of  supervisors.          This  input  could  take  the  form  of  general  comments  on  the  plan.  In  addition,  the  host          competent  authority  should  provide  comments  on  the  parts  of  the  plan  related  to  the          significant-plus  branch  or  comments  concerning  omissions  affecting  the  coverage  of  the  branch          taking  into  account  the  requirements  of  the  EBA’s  Recommendation  on  the  coverage  of  entities          in  the  group  recovery  plan  17.  The  host  competent  authority  should  also  inform  the  consolidating          supervisor  and  the  home  competent  authority  of  any  aspect  of  recovery  planning  relevant  to          the  branch.          	1
72. The input from the host competent authority to the consolidating supervisor or the home     competent authority should include the following information, taking	into  consideration          whether  the  branch  has  been  determined  to  be  significant-plus  because  of  its  importance  for          the  group  or  institution,  or  because  it  is  systemically  important  in  the  host  Member  State:        	1
73. The consolidating supervisor and the home competent authority should prepare the overall     assessment of the group recovery plan or institution’s recovery plan	in  accordance  with  the          requirements  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/1075,  reflecting  the  input          received  from  the  host  competent  authority  in  accordance  with  paragraph  72.  The          consolidating  supervisor  or  home  competent  authority  should  further  consult  on  the  overall          assessment  report  with  the  host  competent  authority.      	1
74. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should endeavour     to ensure that all discussions, consultations and deliberations concerning the	assessment  of  the          (group)  recovery  plan  take  full  account  of  the  timeline  for  the  assessment  of  that  plan  set  out          within  the  college  context.        	1
75. When material deficiencies or impediments identified in the plan relate to the significant-plus     branch, such deficiencies and impediments should be duly reflected	in  the  (group)  recovery          plan’s  assessment  process,  including  in  the  pertinent  joint  decision.  Any  communication  with          the  (EU  parent)  institution  or  the  branch  on  these  matters  should  be  duly  coordinated  between          the  consolidating  supervisor  and  the  home  and  host  competent  authorities  within  the          operational  framework  of  the  college.              	1
76. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should ensure that     the operational framework of the college of supervisors not	only  enables  but  also  achieves  an    	1
77. For that purpose, the consolidating supervisor or the home competent authority should     regularly assess whether an efficient and effective task allocation that	enables  supervision  of          the  significant-plus  branch  in  accordance  with  these  guidelines  has  been  achieved  and,  if  not,          propose  improvements  to  the  college’s  operational  framework  by  means  of  an  amendment  to          the  written  arrangements  or  to  the  college  SEP.              	1
78. The task allocation mechanism established within the college operational framework should be     deemed	 efficient and effective when it achieves the following objectives:	1
79. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should agree on     the terms of the task allocation and duly reflect	them  in  the  college’s  written  coordination  and          cooperation  arrangements.  The  college  should  be  duly  informed  of  the  existence  and,  where          relevant,  the  outcome  of  the  allocation  arrangements.  	1
80. Where dissenting views on the task allocation mechanism arise among the authorities and     agreement is prevented, the authorities should file with the	EBA  a  request  as  referred  to  in          Article  31(c)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1093/2010  along  with  all  information  necessary  for  the  EBA          to  form  an  opinion  on  the  disputed  issues  and  assist  the  authorities  in  coming  to  a  common          conclusion.  All  the  competent  authorities  involved  should  take  into  account  the  EBA’s  opinion          and  settle  the  issue  accordingly.          	1
81. At a minimum, these terms                 	 should detail the following:	1
82. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities should inform the     institution and the significant-plus branch about the task allocation	in  accordance  with  the          college’s  communication  framework.        	1
83. For the purpose of putting in place the most efficient task allocation, the consolidating     supervisor and the home and host competent authorities	should  examine  the  legal  and          operational  feasibility  of  the  delegation  of  tasks,  where  it  is  allowed  under  EU  or  national          legislation,  with  a  view  to  establishing  this  as  a  task  allocation  mechanism.  The  examination  of          the  legal  and  operational  feasibility  of  delegation  should  be  made  on  a  voluntary  and  a  by-task          basis  without  prejudice  to  the  competences  and  responsibilities  allocated  to  national          authorities  or  Union  institutions.            	1
84. Any delegation of tasks on a voluntary basis should be in line with EU and national legislation     and be fully agreed among	the  authorities  involved  at  least  with  regard  to  the  elements  referred          to  in  paragraph  81  and  any  other  elements  required  to  establish  a  legally  safe  and  fully          operational  mechanism  for  task  allocation.      	1
85. The consolidating supervisor and the home and host competent authorities involved in the     supervision of a significant-plus branch should work out the	best  possible  allocation  of  tasks      	1
17. The proportionality principle encoded in Article 74(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU aims to      ensure that internal governance arrangements are consistent with the	individual  risk  profile            and  business  model  of  the  institution,  so  that  the  objectives  of  the  regulatory  requirements            are  effectively  achieved.            	1
 18. Institutions should take into account their size and internal organisation, and the nature,      scale and complexity of their activities, when	developing  and  implementing  internal            governance  arrangements.  Significant  institutions  should  have  more  sophisticated            governance  arrangements,  while  small  and  less  complex  institutions  may  implement  simpler            governance  arrangements.      	1
 19. For the purpose of the application of the principle of proportionality and in order to ensure      an appropriate implementation of	the  requirements,  the  following  criteria  should  be  taken            into  account  by  institutions  and  competent  authorities:    	1
20. In accordance with Article 88(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the management body must have      ultimate and overall responsibility for the institution and	defines,  oversees  and  is            accountable  for  the  implementation  of  the  governance  arrangements  within  the  institution            that  ensure  effective  and  prudent  management  of  the  institution.    	1
 21. The duties of the management body should be clearly defined, distinguishing between the      duties of the management (executive) function and	of  the  supervisory  (non-executive)            function.  The  responsibilities  and  duties  of  the  management  body  should  be  described  in  a            written  document  and  duly  approved  by  the  management  body.            	1
 22. All members of the management body should be fully aware of the structure and      responsibilities of the management body, and	of  the  division  of  tasks  between  different            functions  of  the  management  body  and  its  committees.  In  order  to  have  appropriate  checks            and  balances  in  place,  its  decision-making  should  not  be  dominated  by  a  single  member  or  a            small  subset  of  its  members.  The  management  body  in  its  supervisory  function  and  in  its            management  function  should  interact  effectively.  Both  functions  should  provide  each  other            with  sufficient  information  to  allow  them  to  perform  their  respective  roles.              	1
 23. The management body’s responsibilities should include setting, approving and overseeing      the	 implementation of:       	1
 24. The management body must oversee the process of disclosure and communications with      external stakeholders	 and competent authorities.   	1
 25. All members of the management body should be informed about the overall activity,      financial and risk situation of the institution,	taking  into  account  the  economic  environment,            and  about  decisions  taken  that  have  a  major  impact  on  the  institution’s  business.          	1
 26. A member of the management body may be responsible for an internal control function as      referred to in Title V,	Section  19.1,  provided  that  the  member  does  not  have  other            mandates  that  would  compromise  the  member’s  internal  control  activities  and  the            independence  of  the  internal  control  function.            	1
 27. The management body should monitor, periodically review and address any weaknesses      identified regarding the implementation of processes, strategies and policies	related  to  the            responsibilities  listed  in  paragraphs  23  and  24.  The  internal  governance  framework  and  its            implementation  should  be  reviewed  and  updated  on  a  periodic  basis  taking  into  account  the            proportionality  principle,  as  further  explained  in  Title  I.  A  deeper  review  should  be  carried            out  where  material  changes  affect  the  institution.              	1
28. The management body in its management function should engage actively in the business of      an institution and should take decisions on	a  sound  and  well-informed  basis.      	1
 29. The management body in its management function should be responsible for the      implementation of the strategies set by the management	body  and  discuss  regularly  the            implementation  and  appropriateness  of  those  strategies  with  the  management  body  in  its            supervisory  function.  The  operational  implementation  may  be  performed  by  the            institution’s  management.            	1
 30. The management body in its management function should constructively challenge and      critically review propositions, explanations and information received when exercising	its            judgement  and  taking  decisions.  The  management  body  in  its  management  function  should            comprehensively  report,  and  inform  regularly  and  where  necessary  without  undue  delay  the            management  body  in  its  supervisory  function  of  the  relevant  elements  for  the  assessment  of            a  situation,  the  risks  and  developments  affecting  or  that  may  affect  the  institution,  e.g.            material  decisions  on  business  activities  and  risks  taken,  the  evaluation  of  the  institution’s            economic  and  business  environment,  liquidity  and  sound  capital  base,  and  assessment  of  its            material  risk  exposures.      	1
31. The role of the members of the management body in its supervisory function should include      monitoring and constructively challenging the strategy	of  the  institution.          	1
 32. Without prejudice to national law the management body in its supervisory function should      include independent members as provided for in	Section  9.3  of  the  joint  ESMA  and  EBA            guidelines  on  the  assessment  of  the  suitability  of  members  of  the  management  body  and            key  function  holders  under  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  Directive  2014/65/EU.    	1
 33. Without prejudice to the responsibilities assigned under the applicable national company      law, the management body	 in its supervisory function should:	1
34. The chair of the management body should lead the management body, should contribute to      an efficient flow of information within the	management  body  and  between  the            management  body  and  the  committees  thereof,  where  established,  and  should  be            responsible  for  its  effective  overall  functioning.        	1
 35. The chair should encourage and promote open and critical discussion and ensure that      dissenting views can be expressed and discussed	within  the  decision-making  process.        	1
 36. As a general principle, the chair of the management body should be a non-executive      member. Where the chair is permitted	to  assume  executive  duties,  the  institution  should            have  measures  in  place  to  mitigate  any  adverse  impact  on  the  institution’s  checks  and            balances  (e.g.  by  designating  a  lead  board  member  or  a  senior  independent  board  member,            or  by  having  a  larger  number  of  non-executive  members  within  the  management  body  in  its            supervisory  function).  In  particular,  in  accordance  with  Article  88(1)(e)  of            Directive  2013/36/EU,  the  chair  of  the  management  body  in  its  supervisory  function  of  an            institution  must  not  exercise  simultaneously  the  functions  of  a  CEO  within  the  same            institution,  unless  justified  by  the  institution  and  authorised  by  competent  authorities.  	1
 37. The chair should set meeting agendas and ensure that strategic issues are discussed with      priority. He or she should ensure	that  decisions  of  the  management  body  are  taken  on  a            sound  and  well-informed  basis  and  that  documents  and  information  are  received  in  enough            time  before  the  meeting.            	1
 38. The chair of the management body should contribute to a clear allocation of duties between      members of the management body	and  the  existence  of  an  efficient  flow  of  information            between  them,  in  order  to  allow  the  members  of  the  management  body  in  its  supervisory            function  to  constructively  contribute  to  discussions  and  to  cast  their  votes  on  a  sound  and            well-informed  basis.  	1
 39. In accordance with Article 109(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU in conjunction with Articles 76(3),      88(2), and 95(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, all	institutions  that  are  themselves  significant,            considering  the  individual,  sub-consolidated  and  consolidated  levels,  must  establish  risk,            nomination  12  and  remuneration  13  committees  to  advise  the  management  body  in  its            supervisory  function  and  to  prepare  the  decisions  to  be  taken  by  this  body.  Non-significant            institutions,  including  when  they  are  within  the  scope  of  prudential  consolidation  of  an            institution  that  is  significant  in  a  sub-consolidated  or  consolidated  situation,  are  not  obliged            to  establish  those  committees.        	1
 40. Where no risk or nomination committee is established, the references in these guidelines to      those committees should be construed as	applying  to  the  management  body  in  its            supervisory  function,  taking  into  account  the  principle  of  proportionality  as  set  out  in  Title  I.    	1
 41. Institutions may, taking into account the criteria set out in Title I of these guidelines,      establish other committees (e.g. ethics,	conduct  and  compliance  committees).        	1
 42. Institutions should ensure a clear allocation and distribution of duties and tasks between      specialised 	committees of the management body. 	1
 43. Each committee should have a documented mandate, including the scope of its      responsibilities, from the management body in its supervisory	function  and  establish            appropriate  working  procedures.        	1
 44. Committees should support the supervisory function in specific areas and facilitate the      development and implementation of a sound internal governance	framework.  Delegating  to            committees  does  not  in  any  way  release  the  management  body  in  its  supervisory  function            from  collectively  fulfilling  its  duties  and  responsibilities.    	1
45. All committees should be chaired by a non-executive member of the management body      who is able 	to exercise objective judgement. 	1
 46. Independent members 15 of the management body in its supervisory function should be      actively	 involved in committees.   	1
 47. Where committees have to be set up in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU or national      law, they should be composed of	at  least  three  members.  12      See  also  the  joint  ESMA  and  EBA  guidelines  on  the  assessment  of  the  suitability  of  members  of  the  management  body  and  key  function  holders  under  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  Directive  2014/65/EU.  13            With  regard  to  the  remuneration  committee,  please  refer  to  the  EBA  guidelines  on  sound  remuneration  practices.  14      This  section  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  joint  ESMA  and  EBA  guidelines  on  the  assessment  of  the  suitability  of  members  of  the  management  body  and  key  function  holders  under  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  Directive  2014/65/EU.  15    As  defined  in  Section  9.3  of  the  joint  ESMA  and  EBA  guidelines  on  the  assessment  of  the  suitability  of  members  of  the  management  body  and  key  function  holders  under  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  Directive  2014/65/EU.              	1
 48. Institutions should ensure, taking into account the size of the management body and the      number of independent members of the	management  body  in  its  supervisory  function,  that            committees  are  not  composed  of  the  same  group  of  members  that  forms  another            committee.          	1
49. Institutions should consider the occasional rotation of chairs and members of committees,      taking into account the specific experience, knowledge and skills	that  are  individually  or            collectively  required  for  those  committees.  	1
     50. The risk and nomination committees should be composed of non-executive members of the        	  management  body  in  its  supervisory  function  of  the  institution  concerned.  The  audit      committee  should  be  composed  in  accordance  with  Article  41  of  Directive  2006/43/EC  16.      The  remuneration  committee  should  be  composed  in  accordance  with  Section  2.4.1  of  the      EBA  guidelines  on  sound  remuneration  policies  17.          	1
 51. In G-SIIs and O-SIIs, the nomination committee should include a majority of members who      are independent and be chaired by	an  independent  member.  In  other  significant            institutions,  determined  by  competent  authorities  or  national  law,  the  nomination            committee  should  include  a  sufficient  number  of  members  who  are  independent;  such            institutions  may  also  consider  as  a  good  practice  having  a  chair  of  the  nomination            committee  who  is  independent.          	1
     52. Members of the nomination committee should have, individually and collectively,          appropriate knowledge,	skills  and  expertise  concerning  the  selection  process  and  suitability      requirements.      	1
     53. In G-SIIs and O-SIIs, the risk committee should include a majority of members who are      	      independent.  In  G-SIIs  and  O-SIIs  the  chair  of  the  risk  committee  should  be  an  independent      member.  In  other  significant  institutions,  determined  by  competent  authorities  or  national      law,  the  risk  committee  should  include  a  sufficient  number  of  members  who  are      independent  and  the  risk  committee  should  be  chaired,  where  possible,  by  an  independent      member.  In  all  institutions,  the  chair  of  the  risk  committee  should  be  neither  the  chair  of  the      management  body  nor  the  chair  of  any  other  committee.  	1
 54. Members of the risk committee should have, individually and collectively, appropriate      knowledge, skills and expertise concerning risk management and control	practices.              	1
55. Committees should regularly report to the management body in its supervisory function. 16   Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of	17  May  2006  on  statutory  audits  of  annual  accounts  and  consolidated  accounts,  amending  Council  Directives  78/660/EEC  and  83/349/EEC  and  repealing  Council  Directive  84/253/EEC  (OJ  L  157  9.6.2006,  p.  87)  as  last  amended  by  Directive  2014/56/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  16  April  2014.  17        EBA  guidelines  on  sound  remuneration  policies  under  Articles  74(3)  and  75(2)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  disclosures  under  Article  450  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  (EBA/GL/2015/22).    	1
 56. Committees should interact with each other as appropriate. Without prejudice to      paragraph 48 such interaction could take the form of	cross-participation  so  that  the  chair  or            a  member  of  a  committee  may  also  be  a  member  of  another  committee.          	1
 57. Members of committees should engage in open and critical discussions, during which 	     dissenting views are discussed in a constructive manner.	1
 58. Committees should document the agendas of 	 committee meetings and their main results      and conclusions.     	1
 59. The risk and nomination      	 committees should at least:           	1
60. Where established, the risk               	 committee should at least:   	1
 61. The risk committee should collaborate with other committees whose activities may have an      impact on the risk strategy (e.g. audit	and  remuneration  committees)  and  regularly            communicate  with  the  institution’s  internal  control  functions,  in  particular  the  risk            management  function.  	1
 62. When established, the risk committee must, without prejudice to the tasks of the      remuneration committee, examine whether incentives provided by	the  remuneration            policies  and  practices  take  into  consideration  the  institution’s  risk,  capital  and  liquidity  and            the  likelihood  and  timing  of  earnings.          	1
63. In accordance with Directive 2006/43/EC 19 where established,   	the audit committee should,      inter alia:     	1
64. In accordance with Article 76(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities may allow      institutions that are not considered significant to combine the	risk  committee  with,  where            established,  the  audit  committee  as  referred  to  in  Article  39  of  Directive  2006/43/EC.              	1
20    Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of	public-interest  entities  and  repealing  Commission  Decision  2005/909/EC  (OJ  L  158  27.5.2014,  p.  77).    	1
 65. Where risk and nomination committees are established in non-significant institutions, they      may combine the committees. If they do so, those	institutions  should  document  the  reasons            why  they  have  chosen  to  combine  the  committees  and  how  the  approach  achieves  the            objectives  of  the  committees.      	1
     66. Institutions should at all times ensure that the members of a combined committee possess,       	    individually  and  collectively,  the  necessary  knowledge,  skills  and  expertise  to  fully      understand  the  duties  to  be  performed  by  the  combined  committee  21.      	1
67. The management body of an institution should ensure a suitable and transparent      organisational and operational structure for that institution and should	have  a  written            description  of  it.  The  structure  should  promote  and  demonstrate  the  effective  and  prudent            management  of  an  institution  at  individual,  sub-consolidated  and  consolidated  levels.  The            management  body  should  ensure  that  the  internal  control  functions  are  independent  of  the            business  lines  they  control,  including  that  there  is  an  adequate  segregation  of  duties,  and            that  they  have  the  appropriate  financial  and  human  resources  as  well  as  powers  to            effectively  perform  their  role.  The  reporting  lines  and  the  allocation  of  responsibilities,  in            particular  among  key  function  holders,  within  an  institution  should  be  clear,  well-defined,            coherent,  enforceable  and  duly  documented.  The  documentation  should  be  updated  as            appropriate.          	1
     68. The structure of the institution should not impede the ability of the management body to      	      oversee  and  manage  effectively  the  risks  the  institution  or  the  group  faces  or  the  ability  of      the  competent  authority  to  effectively  supervise  the  institution.              	1
     69. The management body should assess whether and how material changes to the group’s        	  structure  (e.g.  setting  up  of  new  subsidiaries,  mergers  and  acquisitions,  selling  or  winding-up      parts  of  the  group,  or  external  developments)  impact  on  the  soundness  of  the  institution’s      organisational  framework.  Where  weaknesses  are  identified,  the  management  body  should      make  any  necessary  adjustments  swiftly.  	1
 70. The management body should fully know and understand the legal, organisational and      operational structure of the institution (‘know your structure’)	and  ensure  that  it  is  in  line            with  its  approved  business  and  risk  strategy  and  risk  appetite.              	1
 71. The management body should be responsible for the approval of sound strategies and      policies for the establishment of new structures.	Where  an  institution  creates  many  legal            entities  within  its  group,  their  number  and,  in  particular,  the  interconnections  and            transactions  between  them  should  not  pose  challenges  for  the  design  of  its  internal            governance,  and  for  the  effective  management  and  oversight  of  the  risks  of  the  group  as  a            whole.  The  management  body  should  ensure  that  the  structure  of  an  institution  and,  where            applicable,  the  structures  within  a  group,  taking  into  account  the  criteria  specified  in            Section  7  are  clear,  efficient  and  transparent  to  the  institution’s  staff,  shareholders  and            other  stakeholders  and  to  the  competent  authority.          	1
 72. The management body should guide the institution’s structure, its evolution and its      limitations and should ensure that the structure is	justified  and  efficient  and  does  not            involve  undue  or  inappropriate  complexity.            	1
 73. The management body of a consolidating institution should understand not only the legal,      organisational and operational structure of the group	but  also  the  purpose  and  activities  of            its  different  entities  and  the  links  and  relationships  among  them.  This  includes            understanding  group-specific  operational  risks  and  intra-group  exposures  as  well  as  how  the            group's  funding,  capital,  liquidity  and  risk  profiles  could  be  affected  under  normal  and            adverse  circumstances.  The  management  body  should  ensure  that  the  institution  is  able  to            produce  information  on  the  group  in  a  timely  manner,  regarding  the  type,  the            characteristics,  the  organisational  chart,  the  ownership  structure  and  the  businesses  of  each            legal  entity,  and  that  the  institutions  within  the  group  comply  with  all  supervisory  reporting            requirements  on  an  individual,  sub-consolidated  and  consolidated  basis.        	1
 74. The management body of a consolidating institution should ensure that the different group      entities (including the consolidating institution itself) receive	enough  information  to  get  a            clear  perception  of  the  general  objectives,  strategies  and  risk  profile  of  the  group  and  how            the  group  entity  concerned  is  embedded  in  the  group’s  structure  and  operational            functioning.  Such  information  and  revisions  thereof  should  be  documented  and  made            available  to  the  relevant  functions  concerned,  including  the  management  body,  business            lines  and  internal  control  functions.  The  members  of  the  management  body  of  a            consolidating  institution  should  keep  themselves  informed  about  the  risks  the  group’s            structure  causes,  taking  into  account  the  criteria  specified  in  Section  7  of  the  guidelines.  This            includes  receiving:            	1
75. Institutions should avoid setting up complex and potentially non-transparent structures.      Institutions should take into account in their decision-making the results of	a  risk            assessment  performed  to  identify  whether  such  structures  could  be  used  for  a  purpose            connected  with  money  laundering  or  other  financial  crimes  and  the  respective  controls  and            legal  framework  in  place  22.  To  this  end,  institutions  should  take  into  account  at  least:            	1
 76. In any case, institutions should not set up opaque or unnecessarily complex structures which      have no clear economic rationale or	legal  purpose  or  if  institutions  are  concerned  that  these            structures  might  be  used  for  a  purpose  connected  with  financial  crime.        	1
 77. When setting up such structures, the management body should understand them and their      purpose and the particular risks associated with	them  and  ensure  that  the  internal  control  22        For  further  details  on  the  assessment  of  country  risk  and  the  risk  associated  with  individual  products  and  customers,  institutions  should  refer  also  to  the  final  (once  issued)  joint  guidelines  on  risk  factors:  https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/anti-money-laundering-and-e-money/guidelines-on-risk-factorsand            	1
 78. Institutions should document their decisions and be able to justify their decision   	s to      competent authorities.  	1
 79. The management body should ensure that appropriate actions are taken to avoid or      mitigate the risks of activities within such	structures.  This  includes  ensuring  that:      	1
 80. These structures and activities, including their compliance with legislation and professional      standards, should be subject to regular review by the	internal  audit  function  following  a  riskbased  approach.  	1
 81. Institutions should take the same risk management measures as for the institution’s own      business activities when they perform non-standard or	non-transparent  activities  for  clients            (e.g.  helping  clients  to  set  up  vehicles  in  offshore  jurisdictions,  developing  complex            structures,  financing  transactions  for  them  or  providing  trustee  services)  that  pose  similar            internal  governance  challenges  and  create  significant  operational  and  reputational  risks.  In            particular,  institutions  should  analyse  the  reason  why  a  client  wants  to  set  up  a  particular            structure.          	1
82. In accordance with Article 109(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU, parent undertakings and      subsidiaries subject to that Directive should ensure that governance arrangements,	          processes  and  mechanisms  are  consistent  and  well  integrated  on  a  consolidated  and  subconsolidated  basis.  To  this  end,  parent  undertakings  and  subsidiaries  within  the  scope  of            	1
 83. The management body of a subsidiary that is subject to Directive 2013/36/EU should adopt      and implement on the individual level	the  group-wide  governance  policies  established  at  the            consolidated  or  sub-consolidated  level,  in  a  manner  that  complies  with  all  specific            requirements  under  EU  and  national  law.  	1
 84. At the consolidated and sub-consolidated levels, the consolidating institution should ensure      adherence to the group-wide governance policies by all institutions	and  other  entities  within            the  scope  of  prudential  consolidation,  including  their  subsidiaries  not  themselves  subject  to            Directive  2013/36/EU.  When  implementing  governance  policies,  the  consolidating            institution  should  ensure  that  robust  governance  arrangements  are  in  place  for  each            subsidiary  and  consider  specific  arrangements,  processes  and  mechanisms  where  business            activities  are  organised  not  in  separate  legal  entities  but  within  a  matrix  of  business  lines            that  encompasses  multiple  legal  entities.      	1
 85. A consolidating institution should consider the interests of all its subsidiaries, and how      strategies and policies contribute to the interest	of  each  subsidiary  and  the  interest  of  the            group  as  a  whole  over  the  long  term.  	1
 86. Parent undertakings and their subsidiaries should ensure that the institutions and entities      within the group comply with all specific requirements	in  any  relevant  jurisdiction.        	1
 87. The consolidating institution should ensure that subsidiaries established in third countries,      and which are included in the scope of prudential	consolidation,  have  governance            arrangements,  processes  and  mechanisms  in  place  that  are  consistent  with  group-wide            governance  policies  and  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  74  to  96  of            Directive  2013/36/EU  and  these  guidelines,  as  long  as  this  is  not  unlawful  under  the  laws  of            the  third  country.          	1
 88. The governance requirements of Directive 2013/36/EU and these guidelines apply to      institutions independent of the fact that they may be	subsidiaries  of  a  parent  undertaking  in            a  third  country.  Where  an  EU  subsidiary  of  a  parent  undertaking  in  a  third  country  is  a            consolidating  institution,  the  scope  of  prudential  consolidation  does  not  include  the  level  of            the  parent  undertaking  located  in  a  third  country  and  other  direct  subsidiaries  of  that  parent            undertaking.  The  consolidating  institution  should  ensure  that  the  group-wide  governance            policy  of  the  parent  institution  in  a  third  country  is  taken  into  consideration  within  its  own        	1
 89. When establishing policies and documenting governance arrangements, institutions should      take into account the aspects listed in Annex I to the	guidelines.  While  policies  and            documentation  may  be  included  in  separate  documents,  institutions  should  consider            combining  them  or  referring  to  them  in  a  single  governance  framework  document.              	1
90. The management body should approve and regularly review and update the outsourcing      policy of an institution, ensuring that appropriate changes are	implemented  in  a  timely            manner.          	1
 91. The outsourcing policy should consider the impact of outsourcing on an institution’s      business and the risks it faces (such as	operational  risks,  including  legal  and  IT  risks;            reputational  risks;  and  concentration  risks).  The  policy  should  include  the  reporting  and            monitoring  arrangements  to  be  implemented  from  inception  to  the  end  of  an  outsourcing            agreement  (including  drawing  up  the  business  case  for  outsourcing,  entering  into  an            outsourcing  contract,  the  implementation  of  the  contract  to  its  expiry,  contingency  plans            and  exit  strategies).  An  institution  remains  fully  responsible  for  all  outsourced  services  and            activities  and  management  decisions  arising  from  them.  Accordingly,  the  outsourcing  policy            should  make  it  clear  that  outsourcing  does  not  relieve  the  institution  of  its  regulatory            obligations  and  its  responsibilities  to  its  customers.              	1
     92. The policy should state that outsourcing arrangements should not hinder effective on-site or        	  off-site  supervision  of  the  institution  and  should  not  contravene  any  supervisory  restrictions      on  services  and  activities.  The  policy  should  also  cover  intragroup  outsourcing  (i.e.  services      provided  by  a  separate  legal  entity  within  an  institution’s  group)  and  take  into  account  any      specific  group  circumstances.              	1
     93. The policy should require that, when selecting material external services providers or when        	  outsourcing  activities,  the  institution  must  take  into  account  whether  or  not  the  service      provider  has  in  place  appropriate  ethical  standards  or  a  code  of  conduct.  	1
94. A sound and consistent risk culture should be a key element of institutions’ effective risk      management and should enable institutions to	make  sound  and  informed  decisions.      	1
 95. Institutions should develop an integrated and institution-wide risk culture, based on a full      understanding and holistic view of the risks	they  face  and  how  they  are  managed,  taking            into  account  the  institution’s  risk  appetite.      	1
 96. Institutions should develop a risk culture through policies, communication and staff training      regarding the institutions’ activities, strategy and risk profile,	and  should  adapt            communication  and  staff  training  to  take  into  account  staff’s  responsibilities  regarding  risktaking  and  risk  management.            	1
 97. Staff should be fully aware of their responsibilities relating to risk management. Risk      management should not be confined to risk	specialists  or  internal  control  functions.            Business  units,  under  the  oversight  of  the  management  body,  should  be  primarily            responsible  for  managing  risks  on  a  day-to-day  basis  in  line  with  the  institution’s  policies,            procedures  and  controls,  taking  into  account  the  institution’s  risk  appetite  and  risk  capacity.          	1
 98. A strong risk culture should include but is not       	necessarily limited to:       	1
99. The management body should develop, adopt, adhere to and promote high ethical and      professional standards, taking into account the specific needs	and  characteristics  of  the            institution,  and  should  ensure  the  implementation  of  such  standards  (through  a  code  of            conduct  or  similar  instrument).  It  should  also  oversee  adherence  to  these  standards  by  staff.            Where  applicable,  the  management  body  may  adopt  and  implement  the  institution’s  groupwide  standards  or  common  standards  released  by  associations  or  other  relevant            organisations.        	1
 100. The implemented standards should aim to reduce the risks to which the institution is     exposed, in particular operational and reputational risks,	which  can  have  a  considerable          adverse  impact  on  an  institution’s  profitability  and  sustainability  through  fines,  litigation          costs,  restrictions  imposed  by  competent  authorities,  other  financial  and  criminal  penalties,          and  the  loss  of  brand  value  and  consumer  confidence.    	1
 101. The management body should have clear and documented policies for how these   	  standards should be met. These policies should:  	1
 102. Institutions should monitor compliance with such standa  	rds and ensure staff awareness,            	1
103. The management body should be responsible for establishing, approving and overseeing     the implementation and maintenance of effective policies to identify, assess, manage	and          mitigate  or  prevent  actual  and  potential  conflicts  of  interest  at  institutional  level,  e.g.  as  a          result  of  the  various  activities  and  roles  of  the  institution,  of  different  institutions  within  the          scope  of  prudential  consolidation  or  of  different  business  lines  or  units  within  an  institution,          or  with  regard  to  external  stakeholders.        	1
 104. Institutions should take, within their organisational and administrative arrangements,     adequate measures to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests	of          its  clients.  	1
 105. Institutions’ measures to manage or where appropriate mitigate conflicts of interest     	should be documented and include, inter alia:   	1
106. The management body should be responsible for establishing, approving and overseeing     the implementation and maintenance of effective policies to identify, assess, manage	and              	1
 107. The policy should aim to identify conflicts of interest of staff, including the interests of     their closest family members. Institutions should	take  into  consideration  that  conflicts  of          interest  may  arise  not  only  from  present  but  also  from  past  personal  or  professional          relationships.  Where  conflicts  of  interest  arise,  institutions  should  assess  their  materiality          and  decide  on  and  implement  as  appropriate  mitigating  measures.          	1
 108. Regarding conflicts of interest that may result from past relationships, institutions should     set an appropriate timeframe for which they want staff	to  report  such  conflicts  of  interest,          on  the  basis  that  these  may  still  have  an  impact  on  staff’s  behaviour  and  participation  in          decision-making.          	1
 109. The policy should cover at least the following situations or relationships 	where conflicts of     interest may arise:    	1
 110. Notwithstanding the above, institutions should take into consideration that being a     shareholder of an institution or having private accounts or loans	with  or  using  other  services          of  an  institution  should  not  lead  to  a  situation  where  staff  are  considered  to  have  a  conflict          of  interest  if  they  stay  within  an  appropriate  de  minimis  threshold.    	1
 111. The policy should set out the processes for reporting and communication to the function     responsible under the policy. Staff should have	the  duty  to  promptly  disclose  internally  any          matter  that  may  result,  or  has  already  resulted,  in  a  conflict  of  interest.          	1
 112. The policy should differentiate between conflicts of interest that persist and need to be     managed permanently and conflicts of interest that	occur  unexpectedly  with  regard  to  a          single  event  (e.g.  a  transaction,  the  selection  of  service  provider,  etc.)  and  can  usually  be          managed  with  a  one-off  measure.  In  all  circumstances,  the  interest  of  the  institution  should          be  central  to  the  decisions  taken.        	1
 113. The policy should set out procedures, measures, documentation requirements and     responsibilities for the identification and prevention of conflicts of interest, for	the          assessment  of  their  materiality  and  for  taking  mitigating  measures.  Such  procedures,          requirements,  responsibilities  and  measures  should  include:      	1
 114. The policy should specifically cover the risk of conflicts of interest at the level of the     management body and provide sufficient	guidance  on  the  identification  and  management  of          conflicts  of  interest  that  may  impede  the  ability  of  members  of  the  management  body  to          take  objective  and  impartial  decisions  that  aim  to  fulfil  the  best  interests  of  the  institution.          	1
 115. Actual or potential conflicts of interest that have been disclosed to the responsible     function within the institution should be appropriately assessed	and  managed.  If  a  conflict          of  interest  of  staff  is  identified,  the  institution  should  document  the  decision  taken,  in          particular  if  the  conflict  of  interest  and  the  related  risks  have  been  accepted,  and  if  it  has          been  accepted,  how  this  conflict  of  interest  has  been  satisfactorily  mitigated  or  remedied.      	1
 116. All actual and potential conflicts of interest at management body level, individually and     collectively, should be adequately documented, communicated to the	management  body,          and  discussed,  decided  on  and  duly  managed  by  the  management  body.          	1
117. Institutions should put in place and maintain appropriate internal alert policies and     procedures for staff to report potential or actual breaches of	regulatory  or  internal          requirements,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  and          national  provisions  transposing  Directive  2013/36/EU,  or  of  internal  governance          arrangements,  through  a  specific,  independent  and  autonomous  channel.  It  should  not  be          necessary  for  reporting  staff  to  have  evidence  of  a  breach;  however,  they  should  have  a          sufficient  level  of  certainty  that  provides  sufficient  reason  to  launch  an  investigation.  	1
     118. To avoid conflicts of interest, it should be possible for staff to report breaches outside      	    regular  reporting  lines  (e.g.  through  the  compliance  function,  the  internal  audit  function  or    an  independent  internal  whistleblowing  procedure).  The  alert  procedures  should  ensure  the    protection  of  the  personal  data  of  both  the  person  who  reports  the  breach  and  the  natural    person  who  is  allegedly  responsible  for  the  breach,  in  accordance  with  Directive  95/46/EC.            	1
     119. The alert procedures should be made available  	 to all staff within an institution.      	1
     120. Information provided by staff through the alert procedures should, if appropriate, be         made	available  to  the  management  body  and  other  responsible  functions  defined  within  the    internal  alert  policy.  Where  required  by  the  staff  member  reporting  a  breach,  the    information  should  be  provided  to  the  management  body  and  other  responsible  functions  in    an  anonymised  way.  Institutions  may  also  provide  for  a  whistleblowing  process  that  allows    information  to  be  submitted  in  an  anonymised  way.  	1
     121. Institutions should ensure that the person reporting the breach is appropriately protected         from	any  negative  impact,  e.g.  retaliation,  discrimination  or  other  types  of  unfair  treatment.    The  institution  should  ensure  that  no  person  under  the  institution’s  control  engages  in      	1
 122. Institutions should also protect persons who have been reported from any negative     effects in case the investigation finds no evidence that	justifies  taking  measures  against  that          person.  If  measures  are  taken,  the  institution  should  take  them  in  a  way  that  aims  to  protect          the  person  concerned  from  unintended  negative  effects  that  go  beyond  the  objective  of  the          measure  taken.              	1
 123. In particular, internal alert              	 procedures should:     	1
 125. Without prejudice to the possibility of reporting breaches through the competent     authorities’ mechanisms, competent authorities may encourage staff to first try	and  seek  to          use  their  institutions’  internal  alert  procedures.    	1
126. Institutions should develop and maintain a culture that encourages a positive attitude     towards risk control and compliance within the institution and a	robust  and  comprehensive          internal  control  framework.  Under  this  framework,  institutions’  business  lines  should  be          responsible  for  managing  the  risks  they  incur  in  conducting  their  activities  and  should  have          controls  in  place  that  aim  to  ensure  compliance  with  internal  and  external  requirements.  As          part  of  this  framework,  institutions  should  have  internal  control  functions  with  appropriate          and  sufficient  authority,  stature  and  access  to  the  management  body  to  fulfil  their  mission,          and  a  risk  management  framework.    	1
 127. The internal control framework of the institution concerned should be adapted on an     individual basis to the specificity of its business,	its  complexity  and  the  associated  risks,          taking  into  account  the  group  context.  The  institutions  concerned  must  organise  the          exchange  of  the  information  necessary  in  a  manner  that  ensures  that  each  management          body,  business  line  and  internal  unit,  including  each  internal  control  function,  is  able  to  carry          out  its  duties.  This  means,  for  example,  a  necessary  exchange  of  adequate  information          between  the  business  lines  and  the  compliance  function  at  the  group  level  and  between  the          heads  of  the  internal  control  functions  at  the  group  level  and  the  management  body  of  the          institution.  	1
 128. The internal control framework should cover the whole organisation, including the     management body’s responsibilities and tasks, and the activities of all	business  lines  and          internal  units,  including  internal  control  functions,  outsourced  activities  and  distribution          channels.              	1
 129. The internal control framework of            	an institution should ensure:     	1
130. The management body should be responsible for establishing and monitoring the     adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control framework, processes and mechanisms,	        and  for  overseeing  all  business  lines  and  internal  units,  including  internal  control  functions          (such  as  risk  management,  compliance  and  internal  audit  functions).  Institutions  should          establish,  maintain  and  regularly  update  adequate  written  internal  control  policies,          mechanisms  and  procedures,  which  should  be  approved  by  the  management  body.      	1
 131. An institution should have a clear, transparent and documented decision-making process     and a clear allocation of responsibilities and authority within its	internal  control  framework,          including  its  business  lines,  internal  units  and  internal  control  functions.          	1
 132. Institutions should communicate those policies, mechanisms and procedures to all staff     	and every time material changes have been made.  	1
 133. When implementing the internal control framework, institutions should establish     adequate segregation of duties – e.g. entrusting conflicting activities within the processing	        of  transactions  or  when  providing  services  to  different  persons,  or  entrusting  supervisory          and  reporting  responsibilities  for  conflicting  activities  to  different  persons  –  and  establish          information  barriers,  e.g.  through  the  physical  separation  of  certain  departments.        	1
 134. The internal control functions should verify that the policies, mechanisms and procedures     set out in the internal control framework are correctly	implemented  in  their  respective          areas  of  competence.        	1
 135. Internal control functions should regularly submit to the management body written     reports on major identified deficiencies. These reports should include, for	each  new          identified  major  deficiency,  the  relevant  risks  involved,  an  impact  assessment,          recommendations  and  corrective  measures  to  be  taken.  The  management  body  should          follow  up  on  the  findings  of  the  internal  control  functions  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner          and  require  adequate  remedial  actions.  A  formal  follow-up  procedure  on  findings  and          corrective  measures  taken  should  be  put  in  place.            	1
136. As part of the overall internal control framework, institutions should have a holistic     institution-wide risk management framework extending across all its business	lines  and          internal  units,  including  internal  control  functions,  recognising  fully  the  economic  substance          of  all  its  risk  exposures.  The  risk  management  framework  should  enable  the  institution  to          make  fully  informed  decisions  on  risk-taking.  The  risk  management  framework  should          encompass  on-  and  off-balance-sheet  risks  as  well  as  actual  risks  and  future  risks  that  the          institution  may  be  exposed  to.  Risks  should  be  evaluated  from  the  bottom  up  and  from  the          top  down,  within  and  across  business  lines,  using  consistent  terminology  and  compatible          methodologies  throughout  the  institution  and  at  consolidated  or  sub-consolidated  level.  All          relevant  risks  should  be  encompassed  in  the  risk  management  framework  with  appropriate          consideration  of  both  financial  and  non-financial  risks,  including  credit,  market,  liquidity,          concentration,  operational,  IT,  reputational,  legal,  conduct,  compliance  and  strategic  risks.        	1
 137. An institution’s risk management framework should include policies, procedures, risk     limits and risk controls ensuring adequate, timely and continuous identification, 	      measurement  or  assessment,  monitoring,  management,  mitigation  and  reporting  of  the          risks  at  the  business  line,  institution  and  consolidated  or  sub-consolidated  levels.  	1
 138. An institution’s risk management framework should provide specific guidance on the     implementation of its strategies. This guidance should, where appropriate, establish	and          maintain  internal  limits  consistent  with  the  institution’s  risk  appetite  and  commensurate          with  its  sound  operation,  financial  strength,  capital  base  and  strategic  goals.  An  institution’s          risk  profile  should  be  kept  within  these  established  limits.  The  risk  management  framework          should  ensure  that,  whenever  breaches  of  risk  limits  occur,  there  is  a  defined  process  to          escalate  and  address  them  with  an  appropriate  follow-up  procedure.      	1
 139. The risk management framework should be subject to independent internal review, e.g.     performed by the internal audit function, and reassessed regularly	against  the  institution’s          risk  appetite,  taking  into  account  information  from  the  risk  management  function  and,          where  established,  the  risk  committee.  Factors  that  should  be  considered  include  internal          and  external  developments,  including  balance-sheet  and  revenue  changes;  any  increase  in          the  complexity  of  the  institution's  business,  risk  profile  or  operating  structure;  geographic          expansion;  mergers  and  acquisitions;  and  the  introduction  of  new  products  or  business          lines.          	1
 140. When identifying and measuring or assessing risks, an institution should develop     appropriate methodologies including both forward-looking and backward-looking tools. The 	      methodologies  should  allow  for  the  aggregation  of  risk  exposures  across  business  lines  and          support  the  identification  of  risk  concentrations.  The  tools  should  include  the  assessment  of          the  actual  risk  profile  against  the  institution’s  risk  appetite,  as  well  as  the  identification  and          assessment  of  potential  and  stressed  risk  exposures  under  a  range  of  assumed  adverse          circumstances  against  the  institution’s  risk  capacity.  The  tools  should  provide  information  on              	1
 141. Institutions should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment     methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations	and          assumptions  of  the  models  (including  the  severity  and  duration  of  the  shock  and  the          underlying  risks).  For  example,  models  showing  very  high  returns  on  economic  capital  may          result  from  a  weakness  in  the  models  (e.g.  the  exclusion  of  some  relevant  risks)  rather  than          a  superior  strategy  or  excellent  execution  of  a  strategy  on  the  part  of  the  institution.  The          determination  of  the  level  of  risk  taken  should  not  therefore  be  based  only  on  quantitative          information  or  model  outputs;  it  should  also  comprise  a  qualitative  approach  (including          expert  judgement  and  critical  analysis).  Relevant  macroeconomic  environmental  trends  and          data  should  be  explicitly  addressed  to  identify  their  potential  impact  on  exposures  and          portfolios.  	1
 142. The ultimate responsibility for risk assessment lies solely with the institution, which,     accordingly, should evaluate its risks critically and should not	rely  exclusively  on  external          assessments.  For  example,  an  institution  should  validate  a  purchased  risk  model  and          calibrate  it  to  its  own  individual  circumstances  to  ensure  that  the  model  accurately  and          comprehensively  captures  and  analyses  the  risk.    	1
 143. Institutions should be fully aware of the limitations of models and metrics and use not     only quantitative but also qualitative risk	assessment  tools  (including  expert  judgement  and          critical  analysis).      	1
 144. In addition to the institutions’ own assessments, institutions may use external risk     assessments (including external credit ratings or externally purchased risk	models).          Institutions  should  be  fully  aware  of  the  exact  scope  of  such  assessments  and  their          limitations.          	1
 145. Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the     management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant	units  in  an          institution  are  provided  with  reports  in  a  timely,  accurate,  concise,  understandable  and          meaningful  manner  and  can  share  relevant  information  about  the  identification,          measurement  or  assessment,  monitoring  and  management  of  risks.  The  reporting          framework  should  be  well  defined  and  documented.            	1
 146. Effective communication and awareness regarding risks and the risk strategy is crucial for     the whole risk management process, including the review	and  decision-making  processes,          and  helps  prevent  decisions  that  may  unknowingly  increase  risk.  Effective  risk  reporting          involves  sound  internal  consideration  and  communication  of  risk  strategy  and  relevant  risk          data  (e.g.  exposures  and  key  risk  indicators),  both  horizontally  across  the  institution  and  up          and  down  the  management  chain.    	1
147. An institution should have in place a well-documented new product approval policy     (NPAP), approved by the management body, that addresses the development	of  new          markets,  products  and  services,  and  significant  changes  to  existing  ones,  as  well  as          exceptional  transactions.  The  policy  should  in  addition  encompass  material  changes  to          related  processes  (e.g.  new  outsourcing  arrangements)  and  systems  (e.g.  IT  change          processes).  The  NPAP  should  ensure  that  approved  products  and  changes  are  consistent          with  the  risk  strategy  and  risk  appetite  of  the  institution  and  the  corresponding  limits,  or          that  necessary  revisions  are  made.            	1
     148. Material changes or exceptional transactions may include mergers and acquisitions,         including the potential	consequences  of  conducting  insufficient  due  diligence  that  fails  to    identify  post-merger  risks  and  liabilities;  setting  up  structures  (e.g.  new  subsidiaries  or  single    purpose  vehicles;  new  products;  changes  to  systems  or  the  risk  management  framework  or    procedures;  and  changes  to  the  institution’s  organisation.          	1
 149. An institution should have specific procedures for assessing compliance with these     policies, taking into account the input of the risk management	function.  This  should  include          a  systematic  prior  assessment  and  documented  opinion  by  the  compliance  function  for  new          products  or  significant  changes  to  existing  products.        	1
 150. An institution’s NPAP should cover every consideration to be taken into account before     deciding to enter new markets, deal in new	products,  launch  a  new  service,  or  make          significant  changes  to  existing  products  or  services.  The  NPAP  should  also  include  the          definitions  of  ‘new  product/market/business’  and  ‘significant  changes’  to  be  used  in  the          organisation  and  the  internal  functions  to  be  involved  in  the  decision-making  process.  	1
 151. The NPAP should set out the main issues to be addressed before a decision is made.     These should include regulatory compliance;	accounting;  pricing  models;  the  impact  on  risk          profile,  capital  adequacy  and  profitability;  the  availability  of  adequate  front,  back  and          middle  office  resources;  and  the  availability  of  adequate  internal  tools  and  expertise  to          understand  and  monitor  the  associated  risks.  The  decision  to  launch  a  new  activity  should          clearly  state  the  business  unit  and  individuals  responsible  for  it.  A  new  activity  should  not  be          undertaken  until  adequate  resources  to  understand  and  manage  the  associated  risks  are          available.              	1
 152. The risk management function and the compliance function should be involved in     approving new products or significant changes to existing products,	processes  and  systems.          Their  input  should  include  a  full  and  objective  assessment  of  risks  arising  from  new  activities          under  a  variety  of  scenarios,  of  any  potential  shortcomings  in  the  institution’s  risk  27      See  also  the  EBA  guidelines  on  product  oversight  and  governance  requirements  for  manufacturers  and  distributors  of  retail  banking  products,  available  at  https://www.eba.europa.eu/-/eba-publishes-final-product-oversight-andgovernance              	1
153. The internal control functions should include a risk management function (see     Section 20), a compliance function (see Section 21) and an internal	audit  function  (see          Section  22).  The  risk  management  and  compliance  functions  should  be  subject  to  review  by          the  internal  audit  function.              	1
 154. The operational tasks of the internal control functions may be outsourced, taking into     account the proportionality criteria listed in Title I,	to  the  consolidating  institution  or          another  entity  within  or  outside  of  the  group  with  the  consent  of  the  management  bodies  of          the  institutions  concerned.  Even  when  internal  control  operational  tasks  are  partially  or  fully          outsourced,  the  head  of  the  internal  control  function  concerned  and  the  management  body          are  still  responsible  for  these  activities  and  for  maintaining  an  internal  control  function          within  the  institution.    	1
155. Heads of internal control functions should be established at an adequate hierarchical level     that provides the head of the control function with	the  appropriate  authority  and  stature          needed  to  fulfil  his  or  her  responsibilities.  Notwithstanding  the  overall  responsibility  of  the          management  body,  heads  of  internal  control  functions  should  be  independent  of  the          business  lines  or  units  they  control.  To  this  end,  the  heads  of  the  risk  management,          compliance  and  internal  audit  functions  should  report  and  be  directly  accountable  to  the          management  body,  and  their  performance  should  be  reviewed  by  the  management  body.    	1
 156. Where necessary, the heads of internal control functions should be able to have access     and report directly to the management body	in  its  supervisory  function  to  raise  concerns          and  warn  the  supervisory  function,  where  appropriate,  when  specific  developments  affect          or  may  affect  the  institution.  This  should  not  prevent  the  heads  of  internal  control  functions          from  reporting  within  the  regular  reporting  lines  as  well.      	1
 157. Institutions should have documented processes in place to assign the position of the head     of an internal control function and for	withdrawing  his  or  her  responsibilities.  In  any  case,          the  heads  of  internal  control  functions  should  –  and  under  Article  76(5)  of          Directive  2013/36/EU  the  head  of  the  risk  management  function  must  –  not  be  removed          without  the  prior  approval  of  the  management  body  in  its  supervisory  function.  In  significant          institutions,  competent  authorities  should  be  promptly  informed  about  the  approval  and          the  main  reasons  for  the  removal  of  a  head  of  an  internal  control  function.          	1
158. In order for the internal control functions to be regarded as independent, the following   	    conditions should be met:  	1
159. Taking into account the proportionality criteria set out in Title I, the risk management     function and compliance function may be combined. The	internal  audit  function  should  not          be  combined  with  another  internal  control  function.            	1
160. Internal control functions should have sufficient resources. They should have an adequate     number of qualified staff (both at parent level and at	subsidiary  level).  Staff  should  remain          qualified  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  should  receive  training  as  necessary.    	1
 161. Internal control functions should have appropriate IT systems and support at their     disposal, with access to the internal and external information	necessary  to  meet  their          responsibilities.  They  should  have  access  to  all  necessary  information  regarding  all  business          lines  and  relevant  risk-bearing  subsidiaries,  in  particular  those  that  can  potentially  generate          material  risks  for  the  institutiones.          	1
 162. Institutions should establish a risk management function (RMF) covering the whole     institution. The RMF should have sufficient authority, stature and resources,	taking  into          account  the  proportionality  criteria  listed  in  Title  I,  to  implement  risk  policies  and  the  risk          management  framework  as  set  out  in  Section  17.      	1
 163. The RMF should have, where necessary, direct access to the management body in its     supervisory function and its committees, where established,	including  in  particular  the  risk          committee.          	1
 164. The RMF should have access to all business lines and other internal units that have the     potential to generate risk, as	well  as  to  relevant  subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  	1
 165. Staff within the RMF should possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience in relation     to risk management techniques and procedures, and markets	and  products,  and  should          have  access  to  regular  training.    	1
 166. The RMF should be independent of the business lines and units whose risks it controls but     should not be prevented from	interacting  with  them.  Interaction  between  the  operational          functions  and  the  RMF  should  help  to  achieve  the  objective  of  all  the  institution’s  staff          bearing  responsibility  for  managing  risk.  	1
 167. The RMF should be a central organisational feature of the institution, structured so that it     can implement risk policies and control	the  risk  management  framework.  The  RMF  should          play  a  key  role  in  ensuring  that  the  institution  has  effective  risk  management  processes  in          place.  The  RMF  should  be  actively  involved  in  all  material  risk  management  decisions.              	1
 168. Significant institutions may consider establishing dedicated RMFs for each material     business line. However, there should be a central RMF, including a	group  RMF  in  the          consolidating  institution,  to  deliver  an  institution-  and  group-wide  holistic  view  on  all  risks          and  to  ensure  that  the  risk  strategy  is  complied  with.  	1
 169. The RMF should provide relevant independent information, analyses and expert     judgement on risk exposures, and advice on proposals and risk decisions	made  by  business          lines  or  internal  units,  and  should  inform  the  management  body  as  to  whether  they  are          consistent  with  the  institution’s  risk  appetite  and  strategy.  The  RMF  may  recommend          improvements  to  the  risk  management  framework  and  corrective  measures  to  remedy          breaches  of  risk  policies,  procedures  and  limits.              	1
170. The RMF should be actively involved at an early stage in elaborating an institution’s risk     strategy and in ensuring that the institution	has  effective  risk  management  processes  in          place.  The  RMF  should  provide  the  management  body  with  all  relevant  risk-related              	1
 171. The RMF’s involvement in decision-making processes should ensure that risk     considerations are taken into account appropriately. However, accountability for the 	      decisions  taken  should  remain  with  the  business  and  internal  units,  and  ultimately  the          management  body.              	1
172. In line with Section 18 before decisions on material changes or exceptional transactions     are taken, the RMF should be involved in the	evaluation  of  the  impact  of  such  changes  and          exceptional  transactions  on  the  institution’s  and  group’s  overall  risk,  and  should  report  its          findings  directly  to  the  management  body  before  a  decision  is  taken.      	1
 173. The RMF should evaluate how risks identified could affect the institution’s or group’s     ability to manage its risk profile, its liquidity	and  its  sound  capital  base  under  normal  and          adverse  circumstances.  	1
174. The RMF should ensure that all risks are identified, assessed, measured, monitored,     managed and properly reported on by the relevant units in	the  institution.            	1
 175. The RMF should ensure that identification and assessment are not based only on     quantitative information or model outputs, and take into	account  also  qualitative          approaches.  The  RMF  should  keep  the  management  body  informed  of  the  assumptions  used          in  and  potential  shortcomings  of  the  risk  models  and  analysis.    	1
 176. The RMF should ensure that transactions with related parties are reviewed and that the     risks they pose for the institution are	identified  and  adequately  assessed.        	1
 177. The RMF should ensure that all identified risks are effectively 	monitored by the business     units.      	1
 178. The RMF should regularly monitor the actual risk profile of the institution and scrutinise it     against the institution’s strategic goals and	risk  appetite  to  enable  decision-making  by  the          management  body  in  its  management  function  and  challenge  by  the  management  body  in          its  supervisory  function.          	1
 179. The RMF should analyse trends and recognise new or emerging risks and risk increases     arising from changing circumstances and conditions. It	should  also  regularly  review  actual          risk  outcomes  against  previous  estimates  (i.e.  back  testing)  to  assess  and  improve  the          accuracy  and  effectiveness  of  the  risk  management  process.    	1
 180. The RMF should evaluate possible ways to mitigate risks. Reporting to the management 	    body should include proposed appropriate risk-mitigating actions. 	1
181. The RMF should independently assess breaches of risk appetite or limits (including     ascertaining the cause and undertaking a legal and economic analysis	of  the  actual  cost  of          closing,  reducing  or  hedging  the  exposure  against  the  potential  cost  of  keeping  it).  The  RMF          should  inform  the  business  units  concerned  and  the  management  body,  and  recommend          possible  remedies.  The  RMF  should  report  directly  to  the  management  body  in  its          supervisory  function  when  the  breach  is  material,  without  prejudice  for  the  RMF  to  report          to  other  internal  functions  and  committees.              	1
 182. The RMF should play a key role in ensuring a decision on its recommendation is made at     the relevant level, complied	with  by  the  relevant  business  units  and  appropriately  reported          to  the  management  body  and,  where  established,  the  risk  committee.            	1
183. The head of the RMF should be responsible for providing comprehensive and     understandable information on risks and advising the management body, enabling	this  body          to  understand  the  institution’s  overall  risk  profile.  The  same  applies  to  the  head  of  the  RMF          of  a  parent  institution  regarding  the  consolidated  situation.    	1
 184. The head of the RMF should have sufficient expertise, independence and seniority to     challenge decisions that affect an institution’s exposure to	risks.  When  the  head  of  the  RMF          is  not  a  member  of  the  management  body,  significant  institutions  should  appoint  an          independent  head  of  the  RMF  who  has  no  responsibilities  for  other  functions  and  reports          directly  to  the  management  body.  Where  it  is  not  proportionate  to  appoint  a  person  who  is          dedicated  only  to  the  role  of  head  of  the  RMF,  taking  into  account  the  principle  of          proportionality  as  set  out  in  Title  I,  this  function  can  be  combined  with  the  head  of  the          compliance  function  or  can  be  performed  by  another  senior  person,  provided  there  is  no          conflict  of  interest  between  the  functions  combined.  In  any  case,  this  person  should  have          sufficient  authority,  stature  and  independence  (e.g.  head  of  legal).      	1
 185. The head of the RMF should be able to challenge decisions taken by the institution’s     management and its management body, and	the  grounds  for  objections  should  be  formally          documented.  If  an  institution  wishes  to  grant  the  head  of  the  RMF  the  right  to  veto          decisions  (e.g.  a  credit  or  investment  decision  or  the  setting  of  a  limit)  made  at  levels  below    	1
      the management body, it should specify the scope of such a veto right, the escalation or     	  appeal  procedures,  and  how  the  management  body  will  be  involved.        	1
187. Institutions should establish a permanent and effective compliance function to manage     compliance risk and should appoint a person to be responsible for	this  function  across  the          entire  institution  (the  compliance  officer  or  head  of  compliance).          	1
 188. Where it is not proportionate to appoint a person who is dedicated only to the role of     head of compliance, taking	into  account  the  principle  of  proportionality  as  set  out  in  Title  I,          this  function  can  be  combined  with  the  head  of  the  RMF  or  can  be  performed  by  another          senior  person  (e.g.  head  of  legal),  provided  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest  between  the          functions  combined.            	1
 189. The compliance function, including the head of compliance, should be independent of the     business lines and internal units it controls and	have  sufficient  authority,  stature  and          resources.  Taking  into  account  the  proportionality  criteria  set  out  in  Title  I,  this  function  may          be  assisted  by  the  RMF  or  combined  with  the  RMF  or  other  appropriate  functions,  e.g.  the          legal  division  or  human  resources.        	1
 190. Staff within the compliance function should possess sufficient knowledge, skills and     experience in relation to compliance and relevant procedures, and should	have  access  to          regular  training.            	1
 191. The management body in its supervisory function should oversee the implementation of a     well-documented compliance policy, which should be communicated to	all  staff.  Institutions          should  set  up  a  process  to  regularly  assess  changes  in  the  law  and  regulations  applicable  to          its  activities.              	1
 192. The compliance function should advise the management body on measures to be taken to     ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations	and  standards,  and  should  assess          the  possible  impact  of  any  changes  in  the  legal  or  regulatory  environment  on  the          institution’s  activities  and  compliance  framework.        	1
 193. The compliance function should ensure that compliance monitoring is carried out through     a structured and well-defined compliance monitoring programme and that	the  compliance          policy  is  observed.  The  compliance  function  should  report  to  the  management  body  and          communicate  as  appropriate  with  the  RMF  on  the  institution’s  compliance  risk  and  its              	1
      management. The compliance function and the RMF should cooperate and exchange       information as appropriate to	perform  their  respective  tasks.  The  findings  of  the  compliance              function  should  be  taken  into  account  by  the  management  body  and  the  RMF  in  decisionmaking  processes.          	1
 194. In line with Section 18 of these guidelines, the compliance function should also verify, in     close cooperation with the RMF and	the  legal  unit,  that  new  products  and  new  procedures          comply  with  the  current  legal  framework  and,  where  appropriate,  with  any  known          forthcoming  changes  to  legislation,  regulations  and  supervisory  requirements.            	1
 195. Institutions should take appropriate action against internal or external fraudulent     behaviour and breaches of discipline (e.g. breaches of internal procedures, breaches	of          limits).    	1
 196. Institutions should ensure that their subsidiaries and branches take steps to ensure that     their operations are compliant with local laws and	regulations.  If  local  laws  and  regulations          hamper  the  application  of  stricter  procedures  and  compliance  systems  implemented  by  the          group,  especially  if  they  prevent  the  disclosure  and  exchange  of  necessary  information          between  entities  within  the  group,  subsidiaries  and  branches  should  inform  the  compliance          officer  or  the  head  of  compliance  of  the  consolidating  institution.      	1
197. Institutions should set up an independent and effective internal audit function (IAF),     taking into account the proportionality criteria set out in Title	I,  and  should  appoint  a  person          to  be  responsible  for  this  function  across  the  entire  institution.  The  IAF  should  be          independent  and  have  sufficient  authority,  stature  and  resources.  In  particular,  the          institution  should  ensure  that  the  qualification  of  the  IAF’s  staff  members  and  the  IAF’s          resources,  in  particular  its  auditing  tools  and  risk  analysis  methods,  are  adequate  for  the          institution’s  size  and  locations,  and  the  nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  the  risks  associated          with  the  institution’s  business  model,  activities,  risk  culture  and  risk  appetite.          	1
 198. The IAF should be independent of the audited activities. Therefore, 	 the IAF should not be     combined with other functions. 	1
 199. The IAF should, following a risk-based approach, independently review and provide     objective assurance of the compliance of all activities and units	of  an  institution,  including          outsourced  activities,  with  the  institution’s  policies  and  procedures  and  with  external          requirements.  Each  entity  within  the  group  should  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  IAF.            	1
 200. The IAF should not be involved in designing, selecting, establishing and implementing     specific internal control policies, mechanisms and procedures, and risk	limits.  However,  this          should  not  prevent  the  management  body  in  its  management  function  from  requesting          input  from  internal  audit  on  matters  related  to  risk,  internal  controls  and  compliance  with          applicable  rules.              	1
 201. The IAF should assess whether the institution’s internal control framework as set out in     Section 15 is both effective and efficient.	In  particular,  the  IAF  should  assess:    	1
 202. The IAF should verify, in particular, the integrity of the processes ensuring the reliability of     the institution’s methods and techniques, and	the  assumptions  and  sources  of  information          used  in  its  internal  models  (e.g.  risk  modelling  and  accounting  measurements).  It  should  also          evaluate  the  quality  and  use  of  qualitative  risk  identification  and  assessment  tools  and  the          risk  mitigation  measures  taken.              	1
 203. The IAF should have unfettered institution-wide access to all the records, documents,     information and buildings of the institution. This should include	access  to  management          information  systems  and  minutes  of  all  committees  and  decision-making  bodies.          	1
 204. The IAF should adhere to national and international professional standards. An example     of the professional standards referred to here is the	standards  established  by  the  Institute          of  Internal  Auditors.      	1
 205. Internal audit work should be performed in accordance with an audit plan and a detailed   	  audit programme following a risk-based approach.	1
 206. An internal audit plan should be drawn up at least once a year on the basis of the annual     internal audit	control  objectives.  The  internal  audit  plan  should  be  approved  by  the          management  body.          	1
 207. All audit recommendations should be subject to a formal follow-up procedure by the     appropriate levels of management to ensure and report	on  their  effective  and  timely          resolution.          	1
 208. Institutions should establish a sound business continuity management plan to ensure     their ability to operate on an ongoing basis and to	limit  losses  in  the  event  of  severe          business  disruption.    	1
 209. Institutions may establish a specific independent business continuity  	 function, e.g. as part     of the RMF 29.   	1
 210. An institution’s business relies on several critical resources (e.g. IT systems including cloud     services, communication systems and buildings). The purpose of	business  continuity          management  is  to  reduce  the  operational,  financial,  legal,  reputational  and  other  material          consequences  arising  from  a  disaster  or  extended  interruption  to  these  resources  and          consequent  disruption  to  the  institution’s  ordinary  business  procedures.  Other  risk          management  measures  might  be  intended  to  reduce  the  probability  of  such  incidents  or  to          transfer  their  financial  impact  to  third  parties  (e.g.  through  insurance).          	1
 211. In order to establish a sound business continuity management plan, an institution should     carefully analyse its exposure to severe business disruptions	and  assess  (quantitatively  and          qualitatively)  their  potential  impact,  using  internal  and/or  external  data  and  scenario          analysis.  This  analysis  should  cover  all  business  lines  and  internal  units,  including  the  RMF,          and  should  take  into  account  their  interdependency.  The  results  of  the  analysis  should          contribute  to  defining  the  institution’s  recovery  priorities  and  objectives.        	1
 212. On the basis of the abovementioned analysis,    	an institution should put in place:         	1
 213. Contingency, business continuity and recovery plans should be documented and carefully     implemented. The documentation should be available within the business lines,	internal          units  and  RMF,  and  should  be  stored  on  systems  that  are  physically  separated  and  readily          accessible  in  case  of  contingency.  Appropriate  training  should  be  provided.  Plans  should  be          regularly  tested  and  updated.  Any  challenges  or  failures  occurring  in  the  tests  should  be          documented  and  analysed,  with  the  plans  reviewed  accordingly.        	1
 214. Strategies, policies and procedures should be communicated to all relevant staff     throughout an institution. An institution’s staff should understand and adhere	to  policies          and  procedures  pertaining  to  their  duties  and  responsibilities.  	1
 215. Accordingly, the management body should inform and update the relevant staff about     the institution’s strategies and policies in a clear and	consistent  way,  at  least  to  the  level          needed  to  carry  out  their  particular  duties.  This  may  be  done  through  written  guidelines,          manuals  or  other  means.      	1
 216. Where parent undertakings are required by competent authorities under Article 106(2) of     Directive 2013/36/EU to publish annually a description of their	legal  structure  and          governance  and  the  organisational  structure  of  the  group  of  institutions,  the  information          should  include  all  entities  within  the  group  structure  as  defined  in  Directive  2013/34/EU  30          by  country.              	1
2. Guidelines set out the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European    System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should	be  applied  in  a  particular  area.        Competent  authorities  as  defined  in  Article  4(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1093/2010  to  which        guidelines  apply  should  comply  by  incorporating  them  into  their  practices  as  appropriate  (e.g.        by  amending  their  legal  framework  or  their  supervisory  processes),  including  where  guidelines        are  directed  primarily  at  institutions  and  payment  institutions.            	1
3. In accordance with Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must    notify the EBA that they comply or intend to comply	with  these  guidelines,  or  otherwise  give        reasons  for  non-compliance,  by  ([dd.mm.yyyy]).  In  the  absence  of  any  notification  by  this        deadline,  competent  authorities  will  be  considered  by  the  EBA  to  be  non-compliant.        Notifications  should  be  sent  by  submitting  the  form  available  on  the  EBA  website  to        compliance@eba.europa.eu  with  the  reference  ‘EBA/GL/2019/02’.  Notifications  should  be        submitted  by  persons  with  appropriate  authority  to  report  compliance  on  behalf  of  their        competent  authorities.  Any  change  in  the  status  of  compliance  must  also  be  reported  to  the        EBA.      	1
18. Institutions, payment institutions and competent authorities should, when complying or     supervising compliance with these guidelines, have regard to the principle of proportionality.	        The  proportionality  principle  aims  to  ensure  that  governance  arrangements,  including  those          related  to  outsourcing,  are  consistent  with  the  individual  risk  profile,  the  nature  and  business          model  of  the  institution  or  payment  institution,  and  the  scale  and  complexity  of  their  activities          so  that  the  objectives  of  the  regulatory  requirements  are  effectively  achieved.        	1
19. When applying the requirements set out in these guidelines, institutions and payment     institutions should take into account the complexity of the outsourced	functions,  the  risks          arising  from  the  outsourcing  arrangement,  the  criticality  or  importance  of  the  outsourced          function  and  the  potential  impact  of  the  outsourcing  on  the  continuity  of  their  activities.            	1
20. When applying the principle of proportionality, institutions, payment institutions 31 and     competent authorities should take into account the criteria specified in Title	I  of  the  EBA          Guidelines  on  internal  governance  in  line  with  Article  74(2)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.    	1
21. In accordance with Article 109 -2 of Directive2013/36/EU, these guidelines should also apply     on a sub-consolidated and consolidated basis, taking into account	the  prudential  scope  of          consolidation.32  For  this  purpose,  the  EU  parent  undertakings  or  the  parent  undertaking  in  a          Member  State  should  ensure  that  internal  governance  arrangements,  processes  and          mechanisms  in  their  subsidiaries,  including  payment  institutions,  are  consistent,  well  integrated          and  adequate  for  the  effective  application  of  these  guidelines  at  all  relevant  levels.      	1
22. Institutions and payment institutions, in accordance with paragraph 21 and institutions that,     as members of an institutional protection scheme, use centrally provided	governance          arrangements  should  comply  with  the  following:        	1
23. In addition to paragraph 22 institutions and payment institutions within a group for which no     waivers have been granted on the basis	of  Article  109  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  Article  7  of          Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013,  institutions  that  are  a  central  body  or  that  are  permanently          affiliated  to  a  central  body  for  which  no  waivers  have  been  granted  on  the  basis  of  Article  21  of          Directive  2013/36/EU,  or  institutions  that  are  members  of  an  institutional  protection  scheme          should  take  into  account  the  following:  	1
24. Where waivers have been granted pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 2013/36/EU or     Article 109(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU in conjunction with Article	7  of  Regulation  (EU)  No          575/2013,  the  provisions  of  these  guidelines  should  be  applied  by  the  parent  undertaking  in  a          Member  State  for  itself  and  its  subsidiaries  or  by  the  central  body  and  its  affiliates  as  a  whole.        	1
25. Institutions and payment institutions that are subsidiaries of an EU parent undertaking or of a     parent undertaking in a Member State to	which  no  waivers  have  been  granted  on  the  basis  of          Article  21  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  or  Article  109(1)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  in  conjunction  with          Article  7  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  should  ensure  that  they  comply  with  these  Guidelines          on  an  individual  basis.    	1
26. Institutions and payment institutions should establish whether an arrangement with a third     party falls under the definition of outsourcing. Within this assessment,	consideration  should  be          given  to  whether  the  function  (or  a  part  thereof)  that  is  outsourced  to  a  service  provider  is          performed  on  a  recurrent  or  an  ongoing  basis  by  the  service  provider  and  whether  this  function          (or  part  thereof)  would  normally  fall  within  the  scope  of  functions  that  would  or  could          realistically  be  performed  by  institutions  or  payment  institutions,  even  if  the  institution  or          payment  institution  has  not  performed  this  function  in  the  past  itself.        	1
27. Where an arrangement with a service provider covers multiple functions, institutions and     payment institutions should consider all aspects of the arrangement within	their  assessment,            	1
28. As a general principle, institutions and payment institutions should not	 consider the following     as outsourcing:       	1
29. Institutions and payment institutions should always consider a function as	 critical or important     in the following situations:34     	1
30. In the case of institutions, particular attention should be given to the assessment of the     criticality or importance of functions if the	outsourcing  concerns  functions  related  to  core          business  lines  and  critical  functions  as  defined  in  Article  2(1)(35)  and  2(1)(36)  of  Directive          2014/59/EU  36  and  identified  by  institutions  using  the  criteria  set  out  in  Articles  6  and  7  of          Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2016/778.37  Functions  that  are  necessary  to  perform          activities  of  core  business  lines  or  critical  functions  should  be  considered  as  critical  or  important          functions  for  the  purpose  of  these  guidelines,  unless  the  institution’s  assessment  establishes          that  a  failure  to  provide  the  outsourced  function  or  the  inappropriate  provision  of  the          outsourced  function  would  not  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  operational  continuity  of  the          core  business  line  or  critical  function.              	1
31. When assessing whether an outsourcing arrangement relates to a function that is critical or     important, institutions and payment institutions should take into	account,  together  with  the          outcome  of  the  risk  assessment  outlined  in  Section  12.2,  at  least  the  following  factors:              	1
32. As part of the overall internal control framework,40 including internal control mechanisms,41     institutions and payment institutions should have a holistic institution-wide risk	management          framework  extending  across  all  business  lines  and  internal  units.  Under  that  framework,          institutions  and  payment  institutions  should  identify  and  manage  all  their  risks,  including  risks          caused  by  arrangements  with  third  parties.  The  risk  management  framework  should  also          enable  institutions  and  payment  institutions  to  make  well-informed  decisions  on  risk-taking          and  ensure  that  risk  management  measures  are  appropriately  implemented,  including  with          regard  to  cyber  risks.42        	1
33. Institutions and payment institutions, taking into account the principle of proportionality in line     with Section 1 should identify, assess, monitor and manage	all  risks  resulting  from          arrangements  with  third  parties  to  which  they  are  or  might  be  exposed,  regardless  of  whether          or  not  those  arrangements  are  outsourcing  arrangements.  The  risks,  in  particular  the          operational  risks,  of  all  arrangements  with  third  parties,  including  the  ones  referred  to  in          paragraphs  26  and  28  should  be  assessed  in  line  with  Section  12.2.          	1
34. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that they comply with all requirements     under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including for their third-party and outsourcing	arrangements.              	1
35. The outsourcing of functions cannot result in the delegation of the management body’s     responsibilities. Institutions and payment institutions remain fully responsible and	accountable          for  complying  with  all  of  their  regulatory  obligations,  including  the  ability  to  oversee  the          outsourcing  of  critical  or  important  functions.              	1
36. The management body is at all times fully responsible       	and accountable for at least:      	1
37. Outsourcing should not lower the suitability requirements applied to the members of an     institution’s management body, directors and persons responsible for the	management  of  the          payment  institution  and  key  function  holders.  Institutions  and  payment  institutions  should          have  adequate  competence  and  sufficient  and  appropriately  skilled  resources  to  ensure          appropriate  management  and  oversight  of  outsourcing  arrangements.            	1
39. Institutions and payment institutions should maintain at all times sufficient substance and not     become ‘empty shells’ or ‘letter-box entities’. To this end,	they  should:            	1
40. When outsourcing, institutions and payment institutions            	 should at least ensure that:   	1
41. The management body of an institution or payment institution 44 that has outsourcing     arrangements in place or plans on entering into such	arrangements  should  approve,  regularly          review  and  update  a  written  outsourcing  policy  and  ensure  its  implementation,  as  applicable,          on  an  individual,  sub-consolidated  and  consolidated  basis.  For  institutions,  the  outsourcing          policy  should  be  in  accordance  with  Section  8  of  the  EBA’s  Guidelines  on  internal  governance          and,  in  particular,  should  take  into  account  the  requirements  set  out  in  Section  18  (new          products  and  significant  changes)  of  those  guidelines.  Payment  institutions  may  also  align  their          policies  with  Sections  8  and  18  of  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  internal  governance.          	1
42. The policy should include the main phases of the life cycle of outsourcing arrangements and     define the principles, responsibilities and processes in	relation  to  outsourcing.  In  particular,  the          policy  should  cover  at  least:              	1
44. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the policy covers the identification of     the following potential effects of critical or important outsourcing	arrangements  and  that  these          are  taken  into  account  in  the  decision-making  process:            	1
45. Institutions, in line with Title IV, Section 11 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance,45 and     payment institutions should identify, assess and	manage  conflicts  of  interests  with  regard  to          their  outsourcing  arrangements.  	1
46. Where outsourcing creates material conflicts of interest, including between entities within the     same group or institutional protection scheme, institutions and payment institutions	need  to          take  appropriate  measures  to  manage  those  conflicts  of  interest.              	1
47. When functions are provided by a service provider that is part of a group or a member of an     institutional protection scheme	or  that  is  owned  by  the  institution,  payment  institution,  group          or  institutions  that  are  members  of  an  institutional  protection  scheme,  the  conditions,  including          financial  conditions,  for  the  outsourced  service  should  be  set  at  arm’s  length.  However,  within          the  pricing  of  services  synergies  resulting  from  providing  the  same  or  similar  services  to  several          institutions  within  a  group  or  an  institutional  protection  scheme  may  be  factored  in,  as  long  as          the  service  provider  remains  viable  on  a  stand-alone  basis;  within  a  group  this  should  be          irrespective  of  the  failure  of  any  other  group  entity.        	1
48. Institutions, in line with the requirements under Article 85(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU and     Title VI of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance,46	and  payment  institutions  should  have          in  place,  maintain  and  periodically  test  appropriate  business  continuity  plans  with  regard  to          outsourced  critical  or  important  functions.  Institutions  and  payment  institutions  within  a  group          or  institutional  protection  scheme  may  rely  on  centrally  established  business  continuity  plans          regarding  their  outsourced  functions.    	1
49. Business continuity plans should take into account the possible event that the quality of the     provision of the outsourced critical or important	function  deteriorates  to  an  unacceptable  level          or  fails.  Such  plans  should  also  take  into  account  the  potential  impact  of  the  insolvency  or  other          failures  of  service  providers  and,  where  relevant,  political  risks  in  the  service  provider’s          jurisdiction.  	1
50. The internal audit function’s 47 activities should cover, following a risk-based approach, the     independent review of outsourced activities. The audit plan48 and	programme  should  include,          in  particular,  the  outsourcing  arrangements  of  critical  or  important  functions.          	1
51. With regard to the outsourcing process, the internal audit  	 function should at least ascertain:          	1
52. As part of their risk management framework, institutions and payment institutions should     maintain an updated register of information on all outsourcing arrangements	at  the  institution          and,  where  applicable,  at  sub-consolidated  and  consolidated  levels,  as  set  out  in  Section  2  and          should  appropriately  document  all  current  outsourcing  arrangements,  distinguishing  between          the  outsourcing  of  critical  or  important  functions  and  other  outsourcing  arrangements.  Taking          into  account  national  law,  institutions  should  maintain  the  documentation  of  ended          outsourcing  arrangements  within  the  register  and  the  supporting  documentation  for  an          appropriate  period.          	1
53. Taking into account Title I of these guidelines, and under the conditions set out in     paragraph 23(d), for institutions and payment institutions	within  a  group,  institutions          permanently  affiliated  to  a  central  body  or  institutions  that  are  members  of  the  same          institutional  protection  scheme,  the  register  may  be  kept  centrally.  	1
47Regarding the responsibilities of the internal audit function, institutions should refer to Section 22 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance 	(https://eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/internal-governance/guidelines-on-internalgovernance     	1
-revised-) and payment institutions should refer to Guideline 5 of the EBA guidelines on the authorisation of payment         	              institutions  (https://eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/1904583/Final+Guidelines+on+Authorisations+of+Payment+Institutions+%2  8EBA-GL-2017-09%29.pdf).          	1

54. The register should include at least the following information for all existing	 outsourcing     arrangements:        	1
55. For the outsourcing of critical or important functions, the register should include	 at least the     following additional information:    	1
56. Institutions and payment institutions should, upon request, make available to the competent     authority either the full register of all existing outsourcing arrangements49	or  sections  specified          thereof,  such  as  information  on  all  outsourcing  arrangements  falling  under  one  of  the          categories  referred  to  in  point  (d)  of  paragraph  54  of  these  guidelines  (e.g.  all  IT  outsourcing          arrangements).  Institutions  and  payment  institutions  should  provide  this  information  in  a          processable  electronic  form  (e.g.  a  commonly  used  database  format,  comma  separated  values).              	1
57. Institutions and payment institutions should, upon request, make available to the competent     authority all information necessary to enable the competent authority to	execute  the  effective          supervision  of  the  institution  or  the  payment  institution,  including,  where  required,  a  copy  of          the  outsourcing  agreement.  	1
58. Institutions, without prejudice to Article 19(6) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, and payment     institutions should adequately inform competent authorities in a timely manner	or  engage  in  a          supervisory  dialogue  with  the  competent  authorities  about  the  planned  outsourcing  of  critical          or  important  functions  and/or  where  an  outsourced  function  has  become  critical  or  important          and  provide  at  least  the  information  specified  in  paragraph  54.            	1
59. Institutions and payment institutions50 should inform competent authorities in a timely manner     of material changes and/or severe events regarding their outsourcing arrangements	that  could          have  a  material  impact  on  the  continuing  provision  of  the  institutions’  or  payment  institutions’          business  activities.      	1
60. Institutions and payment institutions should appropriately document the assessments made     under Title IV and the results of their ongoing monitoring (e.g. performance	of  the  service          provider,  compliance  with  agreed  service  levels,  other  contractual  and  regulatory          requirements,  updates  to  the  risk  assessment).    	1
61. Before entering into any outsourcing arrangement, institutions 	and payment institutions     should:           	1
62. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the outsourcing of functions of     banking activities51 or payment services, to an extent that the	performance  of  that  function          requires  authorisation  or  registration  by  a  competent  authority  in  the  Member  State  where          they  are  authorised,  to  a  service  provider  located  in  the  same  or  another  Member  State  takes          place  only  if  one  of  the  following  conditions  is  met:    	1
63. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the outsourcing of functions of     banking activities or payment services, to an extent that the	performance  of  that  function          requires  authorisation  or  registration  by  a  competent  authority  in  the  Member  State  where          they  are  authorised,  to  a  service  provider  located  in  a  third  country  takes  place  only  if  the          following  conditions  are  met:              	1
64. Institutions and payment institutions should assess the potential impact of outsourcing     arrangements on their operational risk, should take into account the assessment	results  when          deciding  if  the  function  should  be  outsourced  to  a  service  provider  and  should  take  appropriate          steps  to  avoid  undue  additional  operational  risks  before  entering  into  outsourcing          arrangements.    	1
65. The assessment should include, where appropriate, scenarios of possible risk events, including     high-severity operational risk events. Within the scenario analysis, institutions and	payment          institutions  should  assess  the  potential  impact  of  failed  or  inadequate  services,  including  the          risks  caused  by  processes,  systems,  people  or  external  events.  Institutions  and  payment          institutions,  taking  into  account  the  principle  of  proportionality  referred  to  in  Section  1  should          document  the  analysis  performed  and  their  results  and  should  estimate  the  extent  to  which          the  outsourcing  arrangement  would  increase  or  decrease  their  operational  risk.  Taking  into          account  Title  I,  small  and  non-complex  institutions  and  payment  institutions  may  use          qualitative  risk  assessment  approaches,  while  large  or  complex  institutions  should  have  a  more          sophisticated  approach,  including,  where  available,  the  use  of  internal  and  external  loss  data          to  inform  the  scenario  analysis.      	1
66. Within the risk assessment, institutions and payments institutions should also take into account     the expected benefits and costs of the proposed outsourcing	arrangement,  including  weighing          any  risks  that  may  be  reduced  or  better  managed  against  any  risks  that  may  arise  as  a  result  of          the  proposed  outsourcing  arrangement,  taking  into  account  at  least:        	1
67. Where the outsourcing arrangement includes the possibility that the service provider suboutsources critical or important functions to other service providers, institutions and payment   	  institutions  should  take  into  account:    	1
68. When carrying out the risk assessment prior to outsourcing and during ongoing monitoring of     the service provider’s performance, institutions and payment institutions	should,  at  least:          	1
69. Before entering into an outsourcing arrangement and considering the operational risks related     to the function to be outsourced, institutions and payment institutions	should  ensure  in  their          selection  and  assessment  process  that  the  service  provider  is  suitable.        	1
70. With regard to critical and important functions, institutions and payment institutions should     ensure that the service provider has the business reputation, appropriate	and  sufficient          abilities,  the  expertise,  the  capacity,  the  resources  (e.g.  human,  IT,  financial),  the  organisational          structure  and,  if  applicable,  the  required  regulatory  authorisation(s)  or  registration(s)  to          perform  the  critical  or  important  function  in  a  reliable  and  professional  manner  to  meet  its          obligations  over  the  duration  of  the  draft  contract.            	1
71. Additional factors to be considered when conducting due diligence on a potential service  	   provider include, but are not limited to:  	1
72. Where outsourcing involves the processing of personal or confidential data, institutions and     payment institutions should be satisfied that the service provider implements	appropriate          technical  and  organisational  measures  to  protect  the  data.    	1
73. Institutions and payment institutions should take appropriate steps to ensure that service     providers act in a manner consistent with their values and	code  of  conduct.  In  particular,  with          regard  to  service  providers  located  in  third  countries  and,  if  applicable,  their  sub-contractors,          institutions  and  payment  institutions  should  be  satisfied  that  the  service  provider  acts  in  an          ethical  and  socially  responsible  manner  and  adheres  to  international  standards  on  human  rights          (e.g.  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights),  environmental  protection  and  appropriate          working  conditions,  including  the  prohibition  of  child  labour.              	1
74. The rights and obligations of the institution, the payment institution and the service provider     should be clearly allocated and set out in	a  written  agreement.          	1
75. The outsourcing agreement for critical or important functions   	 should set out at least:          	1
76. The outsourcing agreement should specify whether or not sub-outsourcing of critical or 	    important functions, or material parts thereof, is permitted.  	1
77. If sub-outsourcing of critical or important functions is permitted, institutions and payment     institutions should determine whether the part of the function to	be  sub-outsourced  is,  as  such,          critical  or  important  (i.e.  a  material  part  of  the  critical  or  important  function)  and,  if  so,  record          it  in  the  register.    	1
78. If sub-outsourcing of critical or important functions is permitted,         	the written agreement should:     	1
79. Institutions and payment institutions should agree to sub-outsourcing           	 only if the subcontractor undertakes to: 	1
80. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the service provider appropriately     oversees the sub-service providers, in line with the policy defined by	the  institution  or  payment          institution.  If  the  sub-outsourcing  proposed  could  have  material  adverse  effects  on  the          outsourcing  arrangement  of  a  critical  or  important  function  or  would  lead  to  a  material  increase          of  risk,  including  where  the  conditions  in  paragraph  79  would  not  be  met,  the  institution  or          payment  institution  should  exercise  its  right  to  object  to  the  sub-outsourcing,  if  such  a  right          was  agreed,  and/or  terminate  the  contract.        	1
81. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that service providers, where relevant,     	comply with appropriate IT security standards.     	1
82. Where relevant (e.g. in the context of cloud or other ICT outsourcing), institutions and payment     institutions should define data and system security	requirements  within  the  outsourcing          agreement  and  monitor  compliance  with  these  requirements  on  an  ongoing  basis.      	1
83. In the case of outsourcing to cloud service providers and other outsourcing arrangements that     involve the handling or transfer of personal or	confidential  data,  institutions  and  payment          institutions  should  adopt  a  risk-based  approach  to  data  storage  and  data  processing  location(s)          (i.e.  country  or  region)  and  information  security  considerations.    	1
84. Without prejudice to the requirements under the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, institutions and     payment institutions, when outsourcing (in particular to third countries), should	take  into          account  differences  in  national  provisions  regarding  the  protection  of  data.  Institutions  and          payment  institutions  should  ensure  that  the  outsourcing  agreement  includes  the  obligation          that  the  service  provider  protects  confidential,  personal  or  otherwise  sensitive  information  and          complies  with  all  legal  requirements  regarding  the  protection  of  data  that  apply  to  the          institution  or  payment  institution  (e.g.  the  protection  of  personal  data  and  that  banking  secrecy          or  similar  legal  confidentiality  duties  with  respect  to  clients’  information,  where  applicable,  are          observed).            	1
85. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure within the written outsourcing     arrangement that the internal audit function is able to review the outsourced	function  using  a          risk-based  approach.            	1
86. Regardless of the criticality or importance of the outsourced function, the written outsourcing     arrangements between institutions and service providers should refer to	the  information          gathering  and  investigatory  powers  of  competent  authorities  and  resolution  authorities  under          Article  63(1)(a)  of  Directive  2014/59/EU  and  Article  65(3)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  with  regard          to  service  providers  located  in  a  Member  State  and  should  also  ensure  those  rights  with  regard          to  service  providers  located  in  third  countries.            	1
87. With regard to the outsourcing of critical or important functions, institutions and payment     institutions should ensure within the written outsourcing agreement that	the  service  provider          grants  them  and  their  competent  authorities,  including  resolution  authorities,  and  any  other          person  appointed  by  them  or  the  competent  authorities,  the  following:      	1
88. For the outsourcing of functions that are not critical or important, institutions and payment     institutions should ensure the access and audit rights	as  set  out  in  paragraph  87  (a)  and  (b)  and          	1
89. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that the outsourcing agreement or any     other contractual arrangement does not impede or limit the effective	exercise  of  the  access          and  audit  rights  by  them,  competent  authorities  or  third  parties  appointed  by  them  to  exercise          these  rights.              	1
90. Institutions and payment institutions should exercise their access and audit rights, determine     the audit frequency and areas to be audited on a	risk-based  approach  and  adhere  to  relevant,          commonly  accepted,  national  and  international  audit  standards.53          	1
91. Without prejudice to their final responsibility regarding outsourcing arrangements, institutions   	  and payment institutions may use:       	1
92. For the outsourcing of critical or important functions, institutions and payment institutions     should assess whether third-party certifications and reports as referred to	in  paragraph  91(b)          are  adequate  and  sufficient  to  comply  with  their  regulatory  obligations  and  should  not  rely          solely  on  these  reports  over  time.          	1
93. Institutions and payment institutions should make use of the method r	eferred to in     paragraph 91(b) only if they:    	1
94. In line with the EBA Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the SREP, institutions should,     where relevant, ensure that they are able	to  carry  out  security  penetration  testing  to  assess  the          effectiveness  of  implemented  cyber  and  internal  ICT  security  measures  and  processes.54  Taking          into  account  Title  I,  payment  institutions  should  also  have  internal  ICT  control  mechanisms,          including  ICT  security  control  and  mitigation  measures.        	1
95. Before a planned on-site visit, institutions, payment institutions, competent authorities and     auditors or third parties acting on behalf of the institution, payment	institution  or  competent          authorities  should  provide  reasonable  notice  to  the  service  provider,  unless  this  is  not  possible          due  to  an  emergency  or  crisis  situation  or  would  lead  to  a  situation  where  the  audit  would  no          longer  be  effective.              	1
96. When performing audits in multi-client environments, care should be taken to ensure that risks     to another client’s environment (e.g. impact on service	levels,  availability  of  data,          confidentiality  aspects)  are  avoided  or  mitigated.  	1
97. Where the outsourcing arrangement carries a high level of technical complexity, for instance in     the case of cloud outsourcing, the institution or	payment  institution  should  verify  that  whoever          is  performing  the  audit  –  whether  it  is  its  internal  auditors,  the  pool  of  auditors  or  external          auditors  acting  on  its  behalf  –  has  appropriate  and  relevant  skills  and  knowledge  to  perform          relevant  audits  and/or  assessments  effectively.  The  same  applies  to  any  staff  of  the  institution          or  payment  institution  reviewing  third-party  certifications  or  audits  carried  out  by  service          providers.              	1
98. The outsourcing arrangement should expressly allow the possibility for the institution or     payment institution to terminate the arrangement, in accordance with applicable	law,  including          in  the  following  situations:          	1
99. The outsourcing arrangement should facilitate the transfer of the outsourced function to     another service provider or its re-incorporation into the institution or	payment  institution.  To          this  end,  the  written  outsourcing  arrangement  should:  	1
100. Institutions and payment institutions should monitor, on an ongoing basis, the    performance of the service providers with regard to all outsourcing arrangements on	a  riskbased  approach  and  with  the  main  focus  being  on  the  outsourcing  of  critical  or  important        functions,  including  that  the  availability,  integrity  and  security  of  data  and  information  is        	1
101. Institutions and payment institutions should apply due skill, care and diligence when      	monitoring and managing outsourcing arrangements.    	1
102. Institutions should regularly update their risk assessment in accordance with    Section 12.2and should periodically report to the management body on the risks identified	in        respect  of  the  outsourcing  of  critical  or  important  functions.    	1
103. Institutions and payment institutions should monitor and manage their internal    concentration risks caused by outsourcing arrangements, taking into account Section 12.2 of 	    these  guidelines.        	1
104. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure, on an ongoing basis, that outsourcing    arrangements, with the main focus being on outsourced critical or important	functions,  meet        appropriate  performance  and  quality  standards  in  line  with  their  policies  by:            	1
105. Institutions should take appropriate measures if they identify shortcomings in the provision    of the outsourced function. In particular, institutions and payment institutions should	follow        up  on  any  indications  that  service  providers  may  not  be  carrying  out  the  outsourced  critical  or        important  function  effectively  or  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulatory        requirements.  If  shortcomings  are  identified,  institutions  and  payment  institutions  should  take        appropriate  corrective  or  remedial  actions.  Such  actions  may  include  terminating  the        outsourcing  agreement,  with  immediate  effect,  if  necessary.            	1
106. Institutions and payment institutions should have a documented exit strategy when    outsourcing critical or important functions that is in line with their outsourcing	policy  and        business  continuity  plans,55  taking  into  account  at  least  the  possibility  of:            	1
107. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure that they are able to exit outsourcing    arrangements without undue disruption to their business activities, without limiting	their        compliance  with  regulatory  requirements  and  without  any  detriment  to  the  continuity  and        quality  of  its  provision  of  services  to  clients.  To  achieve  this,  they  should:        	1
108.     When developing exit strategies, institutions and 	payment institutions should:             	1
109. When establishing appropriate methods to monitor institutions’ and payment institutions’    compliance with the conditions for initial authorisation, competent authorities should aim to 	    identify  if  outsourcing  arrangements  amount  to  a  material  change  to  the  conditions  and        obligations  of  institutions’  and  payment  institutions’  initial  authorisation.      	1
110. Competent authorities should be satisfied that they can effectively supervise institutions    and payment institutions, including that institutions or payment institutions have ensured 	    within  their  outsourcing  arrangement  that  service  providers  are  obliged  to  grant  audit  and        access  rights  to  the  competent  authority  and  the  institution,  in  line  with  Section  13.3.        	1
111. The analysis of institutions’ outsourcing risks should be performed at least within the SREP    or, with regard to payment institutions, as part of	other  supervisory  processes,  including  adhoc  requests,  or  during  on-site  inspections.          	1
112. Further to the information recorded within the register, as referred to in Section 11    competent authorities may ask institutions and payment institutions for	additional        information,  in  particular  for  critical  or  important  outsourcing  arrangements,  such  as:              	1
113. In addition to the information required under Section 11 competent authorities may    require institutions and payment institutions to provide detailed information on any	      outsourcing  arrangement,  even  if  the  function  concerned  is  not  considered  critical  or        important.      	1
114.     Competent authorities should assess the following        	on a risk-based approach:     	1
115. Competent authorities should ensure that EU/EEA institutions and payment institutions are    not operating as an ‘empty shell’, including situations where institutions use back-to-back	      transactions  or  intragroup  transactions  to  transfer  part  of  the  market  risk  and  credit  risk  to  a        non-EU/EEA  entity,  and  should  ensure  that  they  have  appropriate  governance  and  risk        management  arrangements  in  place  to  identify  and  manage  their  risks.      	1
116. Within their assessment, competent authorities should take           	into account all risks, in    particular:56	1
117. Where concentration risks are identified, competent authorities should monitor the    development of such risks and evaluate both their potential impact on other institutions	and        payment  institutions  and  the  stability  of  the  financial  market;  competent  authorities  should        inform,  where  appropriate,  the  resolution  authority  about  new  potentially  critical  functions58        that  have  been  identified  during  this  assessment.      	1
118. Where concerns are identified that lead to the conclusion that an institution or payment    institution no longer has robust governance arrangements in place	or  does  not  comply  with        regulatory  requirements,  competent  authorities  should  take  appropriate  actions,  which  may        include  limiting  or  restricting  the  scope  of  the  outsourced  functions  or  requiring  exit  from  one        or  more  outsourcing  arrangements.  In  particular,  taking  into  account  the  need  of  the  institution        or  payment  institution  to  operate  on  a  continuous  basis,  the  cancellation  of  contracts  could  be        required  if  the  supervision  and  enforcement  of  regulatory  requirements  cannot  be  ensured  by        other  measures.              	1
119. Competent authorities should be satisfied that they are able to perform effective    supervision, in particular when institutions and payment institutions outsource critical or	      important  functions  that  are  undertaken  outside  the  EU/EEA.        	1
1.1   The manufacturer should establish, implement and review effective product oversight and       governance arrangements. The arrangements should aim, when	products  are  being  designed              and  brought  to  the  market,  (i)  to  ensure  that  the  interests,  objectives  and  characteristics  of              consumers  are  taken  into  account,  (ii)  to  avoid  potential  consumer  detriment  and  (iii)  to              minimise  conflicts  of  interest.    	1
1.2   The product oversight and governance arrangement should be reviewed and updated by the       	manufacturer on a regular basis.	1
1.3   When launching a new product the manufacturer should ensure that the product oversight       and governance arrangements are considered	in  the  new  product  approval  policy  (NPAP)  in              line  with  Guideline  23  of  the  EBA’s  Guidelines  on  Internal  Governance  (GL  44)  in  cases  where              GL  44  applies.        	1
1.4   All actions taken by the manufacturer in relation to the product oversight and governance       arrangements should be duly	documented;  kept  for  audit  purposes  and  made  available  to  the              competent  authorities  upon  request.    	1
1.5   Product oversight and governance arrangements should be proportionate to the nature, scale       and complexity of the relevant business	of  the  manufacturer.  The  implementation/application              of  the  arrangements  should  have  regard  to  the  level  of  potential  risk  for  the  consumer  and              complexity  of  the  product.            	1
2.1   The manufacturer should ensure that product oversight and governance arrangements are an       integral part of its governance, risk	management  and  internal  control  framework  as  referred  to              in  GL  44  where  applicable.  To  that  end,  the  manufacturer’s  management  body  should  endorse              the  establishment  of  the  arrangements  and  subsequent  reviews.  	1
2.2   Senior management, with support from representatives of the manufacturer’s compliance and       risk management functions, should be responsible for	continued  internal  compliance  with  the              product  oversight  and  governance  arrangements.  They  should  periodically  check  that  the              	1
      product oversight and governance arrangements are still appropriate and continue to meet       the objectives as	set  out  in  Guideline  1.1  above,  and  should  propose  to  the  management  body              that  the  arrangements  be  amended  if  this  is  no  longer  the  case.          	1
2.3   The responsibilities for the oversight of this process by the Risk Control function and the       Compliance function should	be  integrated  into  their  normal  line  of  duties  as  outlined  in              Guidelines  25  26  and  28  of  GL  44  where  applicable.    	1
2.4   Senior management should ensure that staff involved in designing a product are familiar with       and follow the manufacturer’s	product  oversight  and  governance  arrangement;  are  competent              and  appropriately  trained;  and  understand  and  are  familiar  with  the  product’s  features,              characteristics  and  risks.    	1
3.1   Manufacturers should include, in their product oversight and governance arrangements, steps       and features that need to be followed	to  identify,  and  update  when  necessary,  the  relevant              target  market  of  a  product.      	1
3.2   The manufacturer should, having first identified the target market, ensure that the product is       deemed appropriate for the	interests,  objectives  and  characteristics  of  the  identified  target              market(s).              	1
3.3   The manufacturer should only design and bring to the market products with features, charges       and risks, that meet	the  interests,  objectives  and  characteristics  of,  and  are  of  benefit  to,  the              particular  target  market  identified  for  the  product.        	1
3.4   The manufacturer should consider how the product fits within the manufacturer’s existing       product range and whether the presence	of  too  many  product  variants  prevents  the  consumer              from  making  informed  decisions.        	1
3.5   The manufacturer should also identify the market segments for which the product is       considered not likely to meet	their  interests,  objectives  and  characteristics.      	1
3.6   When deciding whether or not a product meets the interests, objectives and characteristics of       a particular target market,	the  manufacturer  should  assess  the  degree  of  financial  capability  of              the  target  market.      	1
4.1   Before a product is brought to the market; an existing product is sold to a new target market;      	or  significant  change  is  made  to  an  existing  product,  the  manufacturer  should  conduct  product              testing,  in  order  to  be  able  to  assess  how  the  product  would  affect  its  consumers  under  a  wide          	1
5.1   Once the product is brought to market, the manufacturer is ultimately responsible for product       monitoring and should monitor	the  product  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  ensure  that  the  interests,              objectives  and  characteristics  of  consumers  continue  to  be  appropriately  taken  into  account.              	1
6.1   If the manufacturer identifies a problem related to the product in the market, or when       monitoring the performance	of  the  product  as  required  in  Guideline  5.1  above,  the              manufacturer  should  take  the  necessary  action  to  mitigate  the  situation  and  prevent  a  reoccurrence  of  detriment.        	1
6.2   The remedial action should include promptly notifying the distributor of changes or       modifications to the existing products and	any  additional  actions  that  need  to  be  taken  to              remedy  the  situation.        	1
7.1   The manufacturer should select distribution channels that are appropriate for the particular       target market. To that end, the	manufacturer  should  select  distributors  that  have  the              appropriate  knowledge,  expertise  and  capability  correctly  to  place  each  product  in  the  market              and  to  provide  appropriate  information  explaining  the  characteristics  and  risks  of  the  product              to  the  consumers.  When  selecting  its  distribution  channels,  the  manufacturer  may  consider              limiting  the  distribution  of  a  specific  product  to  channels  that  offer  specific  features  to              consumers.    	1
7.2   The manufacturer should monitor that the products are distributed to the identified target       market and sold outside the	target  market  only  on  a  justified  basis.  	1
7.3   The manufacturer should take all reasonable steps to ensure that distributors act in       compliance with the objectives of	the  manufacturer’s  product  oversight  and  governance              arrangements.  The  manufacturer  should  take  appropriate  action  when  concerns  about  the              appropriateness  of  a  distribution  channel  are  raised,  for  example  by  ceasing  to  use  the              particular  channel  for  a  particular  product.  In  particular,  the  manufacturer  should  ensure,  on              an  ongoing  basis  that  the  products  reach  mainly  the  particular  intended  target  market  through              the  distribution  channels  used.              	1
8.1   Where relevant, the manufacturer should provide the distributor with a description of the       main characteristics of the product;	its  risks  and  any  limitations;  and  the  total  price  of  the              product  (as  known,  or  reasonably  expected  to  be  known  by  the  manufacturer)  to  be  borne  by              the  consumer,  including  all  related  fees,  charges,  and  expenses.    	1
8.2   The information and details of the products to be provided to distributors should be of an       adequate standard,	clear,  precise  and  up  to  date.    	1
8.3   The manufacturer should ensure that the information given to the distributor includes all      	 relevant details to enable them:	1
9.1   The distributor should establish, implement and review effective product oversight and       governance arrangements which are specific and proportionate	to  its  size  and  to  its  role  of              bringing  products  to  the  market.  The  arrangements  should  be  designed  to  ensure  that,  when              bringing  products  to  the  market,  the  interests,  objectives  and  characteristics  of  consumers  are              appropriately  taken  into  account;  to  avoid  potential  consumer  detriment;  and  to  minimise              conflicts  of  interest.        	1
9.2   The distributor should review and update the product oversight and governance arrangements      	 on a regular basis.  	1
9.3   All actions taken by the distributor in relation to the product oversight and governance       arrangements should be duly	documented,  kept  for  audit  purposes  and  made  available  to  the              competent  authority,  or  the  manufacturer,  upon  request.            	1
10.1 The distributor should ensure that product oversight and governance arrangements are an      integral part of its general systems and controls. To	that  end,  the  management  body,  if            relevant,  should  endorse  their  establishment  and  subsequent  reviews.      	1
11.1 The distributor should use the information provided by the manufacturer and have relevant      knowledge and the ability to determine whether a	consumer  belongs  to  the  target  market.  The            distributor  should  in  particular  take  due  account  of  all  relevant  information  allowing  it  to            recognise  the  target  market  for  which  the  product  is  designed,  and  also  to  recognise  market            segments  for  which  the  product  is  considered  likely  not  to  meet  their  interests,  objectives  and            characteristics.            	1
12.1 The distributor should take into account the information provided by the manufacturer and      disclose to the consumer a description of the	main  characteristics  of  the  product,  its  risks  and            the  total  price  of  the  product  to  be  paid  by  the  consumer,  including  all  related  fees,  charges,            and  expenses,  as  well  as  providing  additional  material  supplied  by  the  manufacturer  to  be            used  by  the  target  market.          	1
12.2 The distributor should sell the product to a consumer who does not belong to the target      market only on a justified	basis.  The  distributor  should  also  be  able  to  provide  information  to            justify  to  the  manufacturer  why  it  offered  a  product  to  a  consumer  who  does  not  belong  to  the            target  market.    	1
12.3 In order to assist the manufacturers in their obligation of product monitoring, the distributor      should collect information to permit the manufacturer	to  decide  whether  the  product  the            distributor  brings  to  the  market  meets  the  interests,  objectives  and  characteristics  of  the            target  market  on  an  ongoing  basis.  	1
12.4 If the distributor identifies any problems regarding the product features, product information      or the target market when offering and selling products,	the  distributor  should  promptly            inform  the  manufacturer  of  the  issue.              	1
1. Where the activity of manufacturing and/or distributing is in whole or in parts outsourced to    third parties or carried out by another entity	in  other  ways,  manufacturers  and,  where        applicable,  distributors  should  ensure  that  in  doing  so,  they  comply  with  the  requirements        established  in  the  CEBS  Guidelines  on  outsourcing  accordingly.  11  This  includes,  in  particular,        guideline  2  which  provides  that  “the  ultimate  responsibility  for  the  proper  management  of  the        risks  associated  with  outsourcing  or  the  outsourced  activities  lies  with  an  outsourcing        institution’s  senior  management”.    	1
2.1. The ASPSP should define key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level targets, including      for problem resolution, out of hours support, monitoring,	contingency  plans  and  maintenance            for  its  dedicated  interface,  that  are  at  least  as  stringent  as  those  for  the  interface(s)  made            available  to  its  own  payment  service  users  (PSUs)  for  directly  accessing  their  payment  accounts            online.              	1
2.2. The ASPSP should define at a minimum, the following KPIs of the availability of the dedicated      interface:    	     the following KPIs for	1
2.3. In addition to the KPIs on availability in Guideline 2.2, the ASPSP should define, at a minimum, 	the  performance  of  the  dedicated  interface:    	1
2.4. For the purpose of calculating the availability indicators set out in Guideline 2.2 for the     	 dedicated interface, the ASPSP should: 	1
3.1 For the purpose of Article 32(4) of the RTS, the ASPSP should provide its competent authority     with a plan for publication of	daily  statistics  on  a  quarterly  basis  on  the  availability  and          performance  of  the  dedicated  interface  as  set  out  in  Guidelines  2.2  and  2.3,  and  of  each  of  the          interfaces  made  available  to  its  own  PSUs  for  directly  accessing  their  payment  accounts  online,          together  with  information  on  where  these  statistics  will  be  published  and  the  date  of  first          publication.        	1
3.2 The publication referred to in Guideline 3.1 above should enable PISPs, AISPs, CBPIIs and PSUs     to compare the availability and performance of	the  dedicated  interface  with  the  availability          and  performance  of  each  of  the  interfaces  made  available  by  the  ASPSP  to  its  PSUs  for  directly          accessing  their  payment  accounts  online  on  a  daily  basis.      	1
4.1 For the purpose of the stress tests referred to in Article 32(2) of the RTS, the ASPSP should     have in place processes	to  establish  and  assess  how  the  dedicated  interface  performs  when          subjected  to  an  extremely  high  number  of  requests  from  PISPs,  AISPs  and  CBPIIs,  in  terms  of          the  impact  that  such  stresses  have  on  the  availability  and  performance  of  the  dedicated          interface  and  the  defined  service  level  targets.          	1
4.2 The ASPSP should undertake adequate stress testing of the dedicated	 interface including but     not limited to:      	1
d.    requests for large         	volumes of data.         	1
4.3 The ASPSP should provide the competent authority with a summary of the results of the stress     tests, including the assumptions used as	a  basis  for  stress  testing  each  of  the  elements  in  letters        	1
5.1 The ASPSP should provide the            	competent authority with:       	1
5.2 As part of the explanation referred to in letter (b) of Guideline 5.1, the ASPSP should provide     the competent authority with a	confirmation  that:            	1
d.    no checks on the consent given by the PSU to the CBPII in accordance with letter (a) of     	              Article  65(2)  of  PSD2  are  performed.    	1
6.1 For the purpose of evidencing compliance with the requirement in letter (b) of Article 33(6) of     the RTS regarding the design of	the  dedicated  interface,  the  ASPSP  should  provide  the          competent  authority  with:              	1
6.2 For the purpose of these Guidelines, a ‘market initiative’ means a group of stakeholders that     have developed functional and technical specifications for	dedicated  interfaces  and,  in  doing          so,  have  obtained  input  from  PISPs,  AISPs  and  CBPIIs.        	1
6.3 Where the ASPSP is implementing a standard        	developed by a market initiative:       	1
6.4 For the purpose of the requirement in letter (b) of Article 33(6) of the RTS regarding the testing     of the dedicated interface,	the  ASPSP  should  make  the  technical  specifications  of  the  dedicated          interface  available  to  authorised  PISPs,  AISPs  and  CBPIIs  or  payment  service  providers  that          have  applied  to  their  competent  authorities  for  the  relevant  authorisation  in  accordance  with          Article  30(3)  of  the  RTS  including,  at  a  minimum,  publishing  a  summary  of  the  specification  of          the  dedicated  interface  on  its  website  in  accordance  with  the  third  sub-paragraph  of  Article          30(3)  of  the  RTS.    	1
6.5 The testing facility should allow ASPSPs, authorised PISPs, AISPs and CBPIIs or payment service     providers that have applied to their competent authorities	for  the  relevant  authorization  to          test  the  dedicated  interface  in  a  secure,  dedicated  testing  environment  with  non-real  PSU  data,          for  the  following:            	1
6.6 The ASPSP should provide the competent authority with a summary of the results of the testing     referred to in Article 30(5) of	the  RTS  for  each  of  the  elements  to  be  tested  in  accordance  with          letters  (a)  to  (g)  of  paragraph  6.5  above,  including  the  number  of  PISPs,  AISPs  and  CBPIIs  that          have  used  the  testing  facility,  the  feedback  received  by  the  ASPSP  from  these  PISPs,  AISPs  and          CBPIIs,  the  issues  identified  and  a  description  of  how  these  issues  have  been  addressed.            	1
6.7 For the purpose of assessing whether the ASPSP meets the requirements in letter (b) of Article     33(6) of the RTS, the competent	authority  may  also  take  into  account  any  problems  reported          to  it  by  PISPs,  AISPs  and  CBPIIs  in  relation  to  Guideline  6.5  above.      	1
7.1 For the purposes of evidencing compliance with the requirement in letter (c) of Article 33(6)     of the RTS, the ASPSP should provide	the  competent  authority  with:        	1
1. the number of PISPs, AISPs and CBPIIs that have used the interface to provide            	              services  to  customers;  and        	1
2. the number of requests sent by those PISPs, AISPs and CBPIIs to the ASPSP via           	  the  dedicated  interface  that  have  been  replied  to  by  the  ASPSP.      	1
7.2 In addition to the evidence referred to in Guideline 7.1, the competent authority should take     into account the information received in the	context  of  Guidelines  6  and  8  when  assessing          whether  or  not  the  ASPSP  meets  the  requirement  in  Article  33(6)(c)  of  the  RTS.      	1
7.3 The 3-month period referred to in letter (c) of Article 33(6) of the RTS may run concurrently     with the testing referred to	in  Article  30(5)  of  the  RTS.    	1
8.1 For the purpose of Article 32(1) and letter (d) of Article 33(6) of the RTS, the ASPSP should     provide the competent authority	with:              	1
9.1 When consulting the EBA in accordance with Article 33(6) of the RTS, competent authorities     should submit to the EBA the Assessment Form	set  out  in  Annex  1  in  relation  to  each  request          for  an  exemption  that  they  intend  to  grant.  Competent  authorities  should  not  take  any          decision  in  relation  to  the  exemption  until  the  earlier  of  receiving  the  EBA’s  comments  on  the          request  or  one  month  from  the  date  that  the  competent  authority  consulted  the  EBA.          Competent  authorities  should  take  due  account  of  the  EBA’s  comments  when  taking  any          decision  on  the  request.  	1
9.2 In derogation from Guideline 9.1, until 31 December 2019 competent authorities that have     notified the EBA that they comply with these Guidelines	can  proceed  to  grant  an  exemption          provided  that  they  have  consulted  the  EBA  by  informing  it  of  their  intention  to  grant  the          exemption  using  the  Assessment  Form  set  out  in  Annex  1.  In  such  a  case,  the  competent          authorities  may  submit  the  Assessment  Form  covering  one  or  more  ASPSPs.      	1
9.3 Competent authorities that have refused to exempt an ASPSP from the obligation to set up     the contingency mechanism referred to in Article	33(4)  of  the  RTS  because  its  dedicated          interface  does  not  comply  with  the  conditions  set  out  in  Article  33(6)  of  the  RTS  and  with  the          requirements  of  Guidelines  2  to  8  should  submit  to  the  EBA  the  Assessment  Form  in  Annex  1          without  undue  delay.  The  negative  assessment  should  be  provided  for  all  denied  requests  to          grant  an  exemption  in  accordance  with  Article  33(6)  of  the  RTS.    	1
9.4 Where an ASPSP is part of a group with subsidiaries in different Member States that will use     the same dedicated interface, each	of  the  competent  authorities  of  those  Member  States          should:    	1
13. Institutions should comply with the general principles referred to in this section, as well as set     limits as referred to under Section	5  as  applicable.          	1
14. Institutions                  	should:       	1
16. The institution’s management body may delegate the reviews set out in paragraph	 15 a) to d)     to senior management.   	1
17. Institutions should set an aggregate limit to their exposures to shadow  	 banking entities     relative to their eligible capital.  	1
18. When setting an aggregate limit to exposures to shadow banking entities, each institution	     should take into account:     	1
19. Independently of the aggregate limit, and in addition to it, institutions should set tighter limits     on their individual exposures to shadow banking	entities.  When  setting  those  limits,  as  part  of          their  internal  assessment  process,  the  institutions  should  take  into  account:              	1
20. If institutions are not able to apply the principal approach as set out in Section 5 their     aggregate exposures to shadow banking	entities  should  be  subject  to  the  limits  on  large          exposures  in  accordance  with  Article  395  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  575/2013  (including  the  use          of  Article  395(5)  of  the  same  Regulation)  (‘the  fallback  approach’).    	1
21. The fallback approach should be applied	 in the following way:                	1
10.Competent authorities should perform the assessment of ICT risk and the governance arrangement and    ICT strategy as part of the SREP process following the	minimum  engagement  model  and  proportionality        criteria  specified  in  Title  2  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.  In  particular,  this  means  that:            	1
11.The principle of proportionality applies throughout these Guidelines to the scope, frequency and    intensity of supervisory engagement and dialogue with an institution and supervisory	expectations  of        the  standards  the  institution  should  meet.        	1
12.Competent authorities may rely on and take into consideration work already undertaken by the    institution or by the competent authority in the context of	the  assessments  of  other  risks  or  SREP        elements  in  order  to  have  an  update  of  the  assessment.  Specifically,  in  conducting  the  assessments        specified  in  these  Guidelines  competent  authorities  should  select  the  most  appropriate  supervisory        assessment  approach  and  methodology  that  is  best  suited  and  proportionate  to  the  institution  and        competent  authorities  should  use  existing  and  available  documentation  (e.g.  relevant  reports  and  other        documents,  meetings  with  (risk)  management,  on-site  inspection  findings)  to  inform  the  competent        authorities’  assessment.            	1
13.Competent authorities should summarise the findings of their assessments of the criteria specified in    these Guidelines and use them for the purposes of reaching	conclusions  on  the  assessment  of  the  SREP        elements  as  specified  in  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.        	1
14.In particular, the assessment of governance and ICT strategy performed in accordance with Title 2 of    these Guidelines should result in findings that inform	the  summary  of  findings  of  the  assessment  of        internal  governance  and  institution-wide  controls  element  of  SREP  as  specified  in  Title  5  of  the  EBA  SREP        Guidelines  and  be  reflected  the  respective  scoring  of  that  SREP  element.  Furthermore,  competent        authorities  should  consider  that  any  significant  adverse  impact  of  the  ICT  strategy  assessment  on  the        institution’s  business  strategy  or  any  concerns  that  the  institution  may  not  have  sufficient  ICT  resources          	1
15.The outcome of the assessment of ICT risk as specified in Title 3 of these Guidelines should inform the    findings of the assessment of	operational  risk  and  should  be  considered  as  informing  the  relevant  score        as  specified  in  in  Title  6.4  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.        	1
16.It is noted that whilst generally competent authorities should assess sub-categories of risks as part of    the main categories (i.e. ICT risk will be	assessed  as  part  of  operational  risk),  where  competent        authorities  deem  some  sub-categories  material,  they  may  assess  such  sub-categories  on  an  individual        basis.  To  this  end,  should  ICT  risk  be  identified  as  a  material  risk  by  the  competent  authority,  these        Guidelines  also  provide  a  scoring  table  (Table  1)  that  should  be  used  to  provide  a  stand-alone  subcategory  score  for  ICT  risk  following  the  overall  approach  to  scoring  the  risks  to  capital  in  the  EBA  SREP        Guidelines.          	1
17.To reach a view on whether ICT risk should be considered as material and therefore the possibility for    ICT risk to be assessed and	scored  as  an  individual  sub-category  of  operational  risk,  competent        authorities  may  use  the  criteria  specified  in  Section  6.1  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.      	1
18.When applying these Guidelines competent authorities should, where relevant, consider the nonexhaustive list of ICT risk sub-categories and risk scenarios as set out in the Annex, noting	that  the  Annex        focusses  on  ICT  risks  that  may  result  in  high  severity  losses.  Competent  authorities  may  exclude  some  of        the  ICT  risks  included  in  the  taxonomy  if  not  pertinent  to  their  assessment.  Institutions  are  expected  to        maintain  their  own  risk  taxonomies  rather  than  using  the  ICT  risk  taxonomy  set  out  in  the  Annex.  	1
19.Where these Guidelines are applied in relation to cross-border banking groups and their entities, and a    college of supervisors has been established, competent authorities	involved  should,  in  the  context  of        their  cooperation  for  the  SREP  assessment  in  accordance  with  Section  11.1  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines,        coordinate  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  the  exact  and  detailed  scope  of  each  information  item        consistently  for  all  group  entities.            	1
20.Competent authorities should assess whether the institution’s general governance and internal control    framework duly cover the ICT systems and related risks and if the	management  body  adequately        addresses  and  manages  these  aspects,  as  ICT  is  integral  to  the  proper  functioning  of  an  institution.              	1
21.In conducting this assessment, competent authorities should refer to the requirements and standards of    good internal governance and risk control arrangements as specified in	the  EBA  Guidelines  on  Internal        Governance  (GL  44)  7  and  international  guidance  in  this  field  to  the  extent  these  are  applicable  given  the        specificity  of  ICT  systems  and  risks.  	1
22.The assessment in this Title does not cover the specific elements of the ICT system governance, risk    management and controls that are focused on	managing  specific  ICT  risks  addressed  under  Title  3  of        these  Guidelines,  but  focuses  on  the  following  areas:    	1
23.Point a) referred to in paragraph 22 while providing information about elements of the institution’s    governance, should mainly feed into the assessment of the	business  model  addressed  under  Title  4  of        the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.  Points  b)  and  c)  further  complement  assessments  of  topics  covered  by  Title  5        of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines  and  the  assessment  described  in  these  Guidelines  should  feed  into  the        respective  assessment  under  Title  5  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.          	1
24.The outcome of this assessment should inform, where relevant, the assessment of risk management and    	controls in Title 3 of these Guidelines.  	1
25.Under this section competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an ICT strategy in    place: that is subject to adequate oversight from the	institution’s  management  body;  that  is  consistent    	1
26.Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a framework in place, proportionate to    the nature, scale and complexity of its ICT activities, for	the  preparation  and  development  of  the        institution’s  ICT  strategy.  In  conducting  this  assessment  competent  authorities  should  take  into  account        whether:      	1
27.If the institution’s ICT strategy requires the implementation of important and complex ICT changes, or    changes with material implications for the institution’s business model,	competent  authorities  should        assess  whether  the  institution  has  a  control  framework  in  place,  appropriate  to  its  size,  its  ICT  activities        as  well  as  the  level  of  change  activities,  to  support  the  effective  implementation  of  the  institution’s  ICT        strategy.  In  conducting  this  assessment  competent  authorities  should  take  into  account  whether  the        control  framework:              	1
28.In accordance with Title 5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should assess whether the    institution has an appropriate and transparent corporate structure	that  is  ‘fit  for  purpose’,  and  has        implemented  appropriate  governance  arrangements.  With  specific  regard  to  ICT  systems  and  in  line        with  the  EBA  Guidelines  on  internal  governance,  this  assessment  should  include  an  assessment  of        whether  the  institution  demonstrates:      	1
29.Further to section 5.2 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should assess whether the    institution’s ICT outsourcing policy and strategy considers, where relevant,	the  impact  of  ICT  outsourcing        on  the  institution’s  business  and  business  model.              	1
30.In assessing the institution’s institution-wide risk management and internal controls    	, as provided by Title         	1
31.Competent authorities should conduct the assessment under point (a) above having regard to both    expected and adverse scenarios, e.g. scenarios included in the institution-specific	or  supervisory  stress        test.  	1
32.With specific regard to b), competent authorities should assess whether the independent control and    internal audit functions, as detailed in paragraphs 104 (a), 104	(d),  105  (a)  and  105  (c)  of  the  EBA  SREP        Guidelines,  are  appropriate  to  ensure  a  sufficient  level  of  independence  between  the  ICT  and  the        control  and  audit  functions,  given  the  size  and  ICT  risk  profile  of  the  institution.          	1
33.These results should be reflected in the summary of findings under Title 5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines    and should form part of the	respective  scoring  in  line  with  the  considerations  in  Table  3  of  the  EBA  SREP        Guidelines.        	1
34.For the assessment of ICT strategy, the following points should be considered       	 in concluding the above    assessment:	1
38.Competent authorities should identify the material ICT risks to which the institutio 	n is or might be    exposed following the steps below.  	1
39.When reviewing the institution’s ICT risk profile, competent authorities should consider all relevant    information about the institution’s ICT risk exposures, including the information under	paragraph  37  and        the  identified  material  deficiencies  or  weaknesses  in  the  ICT  organisation  and  institution  –wide  controls        under  Title  2  of  these  Guidelines,  and  where  relevant  review  this  information  in  a  proportionate        manner.  As  part  of  this  review,  competent  authorities  should  consider:            	1
40.As part of the process to identify the ICT risks with a potential significant prudential impact on the    institution, competent authorities should review documentation	from  the  institution  and  form  an        opinion  on  which  ICT  systems  and  services  are  critical  for  the  adequate  functioning,  availability,        continuity  and  security  of  the  institution’s  essential  activities.    	1
41.To this end, competent authorities should review the methodology and processes applied by the    institution to identify the ICT systems and services that are	critical,  taking  into  consideration  that  some        ICT  systems  and  services  may  be  considered  critical  by  the  institution  from  a  business  continuity  and        availability  perspective,  a  security  (e.g.  fraud  prevention)  and/or  a  confidentiality  perspective  (e.g.        confidential  data).  When  performing  the  review,  competent  authorities  should  conduct  their  review        taking  into  consideration  that  critical  ICT  systems  and  services  should  fulfil  at  least  one  of  the  following        conditions:            	1
42.Taking into account the performed reviews of the institution’s ICT risk profile and critical ICT systems    and services above, competent authorities should form an	opinion  on  the  material  ICT  risks  that,  in  their        supervisory  judgement,  can  have  a  significant  prudential  impact  on  the  institution’s  critical  ICT  systems        and  services.          	1
44.Competent authorities should then map the identified ICT risks that are considered material into the    following ICT risk categories for which additional risk descriptions	and  examples  are  provided  in  the        Annex.  Competent  authorities  should  reflect  on  the  ICT  risks  in  the  Annex  as  part  of  the  assessment        under  Title  03:00:00        	1
45.To assess the institution’s residual ICT risk exposure, competent authorities should review how the    institution identifies, monitors, assesses and mitigates the material risks identified	by  the  competent        authorities  in  the  assessment  above.        	1
46.To this end, for the identified material ICT risks, competent authorities     	should review the applicable:        	1
47.The assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management    and internal control framework as referred to in	Title  5  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines,  as  well  as  the        institution’s  governance  and  strategy  addressed  in  Title  2  of  these  Guidelines,  as  significant  deficiencies        identified  in  these  areas  may  influence  the  ability  of  the  institution  to  manage  and  mitigate  its  ICT  risk        exposures.  Where  relevant,  competent  authorities  should  also  make  use  of  information  sources  in        paragraph  37  of  these  Guidelines.          	1
48.Competent authorities should perform the following assessment steps in a manner that is proportionate    to the nature, scale and complexity of the institution’s activities	and  by  applying  a  supervisory  review        that  is  appropriate  to  the  institution’s  ICT  risk  profile.        	1
49.Competent authorities should review whether the institution has appropriate risk management policies,    processes and tolerance thresholds in place for the identified material ICT risks.	These  can  be  a  part  of        the  operational  risk  management  framework  or  a  separate  document.  For  this  assessment  competent        authorities  should  take  into  account  whether:          	1
50.Competent authorities should assess how the applicable risk management roles and responsibilities are    embedded and integrated in the internal organisation to manage and oversee	the  identified  material  ICT        risks.  In  this  regard  competent  authorities  should  assess  whether  the  institution  demonstrates:      	1
51.Competent authorities should consider whether the Internal Audit Function is effective with regards to	    auditing the applicable ICT risk control framework, by reviewing whether:	1
52.For the identified material ICT risks, competent authorities should assess whether the institution has    specific controls in place to address these risks. The following	sections  provide  a  non-exhaustive  list  of        the  specific  controls  to  be  considered  when  assessing  the  material  risks  identified  under  point  3.2.3  that        were  mapped  to  the  following  ICT  risk  categories:              	1
53.In addition to the requirements in the EBA SREP Guidelines (para 279 - 281) competent authorities    should assess whether the institution has an appropriate	framework  in  place  for  identifying,        understanding,  measuring  and  mitigating  ICT  availability  and  continuity  risks.          	1
54.For this assessment, competent authorities should, in particular, 	 take into account whether the    framework:         	1
55.Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in place for    identifying, understanding, measuring and mitigating ICT security risk. For this	assessment  competent        authorities  should,  in  particular,  take  into  account  whether  the  framework  considers:            	1
56.Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in place for    identifying, understanding, measuring and mitigating ICT change risk commensurate with	the  nature,        scale  and  complexity  of  the  institution’s  activities  and  the  ICT  risk  profile  of  the  institution.  The        institution’s  framework  should  cover  the  risks  associated  with  the  development,  testing  and  approval  of        ICT  systems  changes,  including  the  development  or  change  of  software,  before  they  are  migrated  to  the        production  environment  and  ensure  an  adequate  ICT  lifecycle  management.  For  this  assessment        competent  authorities  should,  in  particular,  take  into  account  whether  the  framework  considers:          	1
57.Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in place for    identifying understanding, measuring and mitigating ICT data integrity risk commensurate	with  the        nature,  scale  and  complexity  of  the  institution’s  activities  and  the  ICT  risk  profile  of  the  institution.  The        institution’s  framework  should  consider  the  risks  associated  with  preserving  the  integrity  of  the  data        stored  and  processed  by  the  ICT  systems.  For  this  assessment,  competent  authorities  should,  in        particular  take  into  account  whether  the  framework  considers:        	1
58.For supervised institutions that fall under the scope of the BCBS 239 principles for effective risk data    aggregation and risk reporting 12 competent authorities	should  review  the  institution’s  risk  analysis  of  its        risk  reporting  and  data  aggregation  capabilities  compared  to  the  principles  and  the  prepared        documentation  thereon,  taking  into  consideration  the  implementation  timeline  and  transitional        arrangements  in  these  principles.            	1
59.Competent authorities should assess whether the institution’s outsourcing strategy, in line with the    requirements of the CEBS outsourcing Guidelines -2006 and further to the	requirement  in  paragraph  85        	1
61.Following the above assessment, competent authorities should form an opinion on the institution’s ICT    risk. This opinion should be reflected in a summary of	findings  which  competent  authorities  should        consider  when  assigning  the  score  of  operational  risk  in  Table  6  of  the  EBA  SREP  Guidelines.  Competent        authorities  should  base  their  view  on  material  ICT  risks  taking  into  account  the  following  considerations        to  feed  into  the  operational  risk  assessment:        	1
14.In accordance with Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions are required to have in    place a remuneration policy for all staff. The remuneration policy	for  all  staff  should  comply        with  the  principles  set  out  in  Articles  92  and  93  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  these  guidelines,        taking  into  account  the  mapping  of  the  requirements  within  Annex  I  11.        	1
15.The remuneration policy should specify all components of remuneration and include also the    pension policy, including, where relevant, the framework for early retirements. The	      remuneration  policy  should  also  set  a  framework  for  other  persons  acting  on  behalf  of  the        institution  (e.g.  tied  agents),  ensuring  that  the  payments  made  are  not  providing  any  incentive        for  excessive  risk-taking  or  the  mis-selling  of  products.  All  institutions  should  consider  which        elements  of  the  remuneration  policy  on  the  variable  remuneration  of  identified  staff  under        Article  94  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  should  be  included  in  the  remuneration  policy  for  all  staff.              	1
16.The institution’s remuneration policy for all staff should be consistent with the objectives of    the institution’s business and risk strategy, corporate culture and values,	long-term  interests  of        the  institution,  and  the  measures  used  to  avoid  conflicts  of  interest,  and  should  not  encourage        excessive  risk  taking.  Changes  of  such  objectives  and  measures  should  be  taken  into  account        when  updating  the  remuneration  policy.  Institutions  should  ensure  that  remuneration        practices  are  aligned  with  their  overall  risk  appetite,  taking  into  account  all  risks,  including        reputational  risks  and  risks  resulting  from  the  mis-selling  of  products.  Institutions  should  also        take  into  account  the  long-term  interests  of  shareholders.        	1
17.Institutions should be able to demonstrate to the competent authorities that the    remuneration policy and practices are consistent with and promote sound and effective	risk        management.      	1
18.Where variable remuneration is awarded, such awards should be based on the institutions’,    business units’ and staff’s performance and take into account the risks	taken.  The        remuneration  policy  should  make  a  clear  distinction  with  regard  to  the  variable  remuneration        and  the  performance  assessment  between  the  operating  business  units,  corporate  and  control        functions.            	1
11   Annex 1 to these guidelines indicates the requirements for which an institution-wide application to all staff in line with the additional guidelines provided is	required  or  recommended.          	1
19.The remuneration policy should support the institution in achieving and maintaining a sound    capital base in line with section 6 of these guidelines. The	remuneration  policy  should  also  take        into  account,  where  applicable,  the  restrictions  on  distributions  under  Article  141  of        Directive  2013/36/EU.        	1
20.The remuneration                   	 policy should contain:   	1
21.Institutions should ensure that potential conflicts of interest caused by the pay out of    instruments as part of the variable or fixed remuneration are	identified  and  managed.  This        includes  that  the  compliance  with  insider  trading  rules  is  ensured  and  that  no  measures  are        taken  that  can  have  a  short-term  impact  on  the  share  or  instruments  price.          	1
22.Where remuneration policies or group remuneration policies are implemented in institutions,    including in their subsidiaries, and the staff of the institution are also the	majority  owners  of        the  institution  or  the  subsidiary,  the  remuneration  policy  should  be  adjusted  to  the  specific        situation  of  these  institutions  or  subsidiaries.  For  identified  staff,  the  institution  should  ensure        that  the  remuneration  policy  complies  with  the  relevant  CRD  requirements  within  Articles  92        and  94  and  these  guidelines.        	1
23.The management body 13 in its supervisory function (hereafter ‘supervisory function’) should    be responsible for adopting and maintaining the remuneration policy of the institution,	and        overseeing  its  implementation  to  ensure  it  is  fully  operating  as  intended.  The  supervisory        function  should  also  approve  any  subsequent  material  exemptions  made  for  individual  staff        member  and  changes  to  the  remuneration  policy  and  carefully  consider  and  monitor  their        effects.          	1
24.The supervisory function should collectively have adequate knowledge, skills and experience    with regard to remuneration policies and practices as well as of incentives and	risks  that  can        arise  therefrom.  This  should  include  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  with  regard  to  the        mechanisms  for  aligning  the  remuneration  structure  to  institutions’  risk  profiles  and  capital        structure.          	1
25.The supervisory function should ensure that the institution’s remuneration policies and    practices are appropriately implemented and aligned with the institution’s overall corporate  	  governance  framework,  corporate  culture,  risk  appetite  and  the  related  governance  processes.      	1
26.Conflicts of interests with regard to the remuneration policy and remuneration awarded    should be identified and appropriately mitigated, including by establishing objective award 	    criteria  based  on  the  internal  reporting  system,  appropriate  controls  and  the  four  eyes        principle.  The  remuneration  policy  should  ensure  that  no  material  conflicts  of  interest  arise  for        staff  in  control  functions.        	1
27.The remuneration policy and practices and the procedures to determine them should be clear,    well documented and transparent. Proper documentation on the decision-making process	(e.g.        minutes  of  relevant  meetings,  relevant  reports,  and  other  relevant  documents)  and  the        reasoning  behind  the  remuneration  policy  should  be  maintained.    	1
28.The supervisory and management functions and, where established, the remuneration and the    risk committees should work closely together and ensure that the remuneration policy	is        consistent  with  and  promotes  sound  and  effective  risk  management.    	1
29.The remuneration policy should provide for an effective framework for performance  	  measurement, risk adjustment and the linkages of performance to reward.   	1
30.Risk and compliance functions should provide effective input in accordance with their roles    into the setting of bonus pools, performance criteria and remuneration awards	where  those        functions  have  concerns  regarding  the  impact  on  staff  behaviour  and  the  riskiness  of  the        business  undertaken.          	1
31.The supervisory function should determine and oversee the remuneration of the members of    the management function and, if the remuneration committee referred to in	section  2.4  has        not  been  established,  oversee  directly  the  remuneration  of  the  senior  officers  in  the        independent  control  functions,  including  the  risk  management  and  compliance  functions.        	1

33.The human resources function should participate in and inform on the drawing up and the    evaluation of the remuneration policy for the institution, including	the  remuneration  structure,        remuneration  levels  and  incentive  schemes,  in  a  way  that  would  not  only  attract  and  retain  the        staff  the  institution  needs  but  also  assure  that  the  remuneration  policy  is  aligned  with  the        institution’s  risk  profile.        	1
34.The risk management function should assist in and inform on the definition of suitable riskadjusted performance measures (including ex post adjustments), as well as in assessing how	      the  variable  remuneration  structure  affects  the  risk  profile  and  culture  of  the  institution.  The        risk  management  function  should  validate  and  assess  risk  adjustment  data  as  well  as  be  invited        to  attend  the  meetings  of  the  remuneration  committee  on  this  matter.  	1
35.The compliance function should analyse how the remuneration policy affects the institution’s    compliance with legislation, regulations, internal policies and risk culture and should report	all        identified  compliance  risks  and  issues  of  non-compliance  to  the  management  body,  both  in  its        management  and  supervisory  functions.  The  findings  of  the  compliance  function  should  be        taken  into  account  by  the  supervisory  function  during  the  approval,  review  procedures  and        oversight  of  the  remuneration  policy.              	1
36.The internal audit function should carry out an independent review of the design,    implementation and effects of the institution’s remuneration policies on its risk	profile  and  the        way  these  effects  are  managed  in  line  with  the  guidelines  provided  in  section  2.5.    	1
37.Within a group context the competent functions within the consolidating institution and   	    subsidiaries should interact and exchange information as appropriate. 	1
38.Depending on the institution’s legal form and on the applicable national law, the approval of    an institution’s remuneration policy and, where appropriate, decisions relating	to  the        remuneration  of  members  of  the  management  body  and  other  identified  staff  may  also  be        assigned  to  the  shareholders’  meeting  in  accordance  with  national  company  law.  The        shareholders’  vote  may  be  either  consultative  or  binding.          	1
39.Where the approval of the remuneration of individual members of the management body and    other identified staff is assigned to shareholders, shareholders should also	explicitly  approve        the  payments  that  can  be  awarded  to  those  persons  at  the  termination  of  their  contracts.        Where  the  approval  of  the  remuneration  policy  is  subject  to  approval  by  the  shareholders  they          	1
40.In order that shareholders can make informed decisions, the supervisory function should    ensure that the institution provides them with adequate information regarding the 	    remuneration  policy  designed  to  help  them  to  assess  the  incentive  structure  and  the  extent  to        which  risk-taking  is  being  incentivised  and  controlled  as  well  as  the  overall  cost  of  the        remuneration  structure.  Such  information  should  be  provided  well  in  advance  of  the  relevant        shareholders’  meeting.  Detailed  information  on  remuneration  policies  and  on  their        modifications,  on  procedures  and  decision-making  processes  to  set  a  remuneration  package        should  be  provided  and  include  the  following:        	1
41.The supervisory function remains responsible for the proposals submitted to the shareholders’    meeting, as well as for the actual implementation and oversight of any	changes  to  the        remuneration  policies  and  practices.          	1
42.Where shareholders are requested to approve a higher maximum level of the ratio between    the variable and fixed component of remuneration of up to	200%,  the  following  should  apply:      	1
43.Shareholders should be able to vote on a reduction of a higher maximum ratio that has been    approved in the past. Such a vote	should  require  a  majority  of  shareholder  votes  in  line  with        the  applicable  rules  for  regular  decisions  foreseen  by  national  law.  Where  the  approved  higher        maximum  was  reduced  the  institution  should  inform  the  competent  authority  of  the  decision        and  the  approved  ratio  within  five  working  days.      	1
44.When informing the competent authority about the recommendation addressed to the    shareholders’ meeting, in accordance with the fourth indent of Article 94(1)(g)(ii) of 	    Directive  2013/36/EU,  the  institution  should  report  to  the  competent  authority  all  the        information  submitted  to  the  shareholders,  including  the  proposed  higher  maximum  ratio  and        the  reasons  therefor,  at  the  latest  five  working  days  after  having  notified  to  the  shareholders        that  an  approval  of  the  higher  ratio  will  be  sought.        	1
45.When informing the competent authority about the decision taken by its shareholders, in    accordance with the fifth indent of Article 94(1)(g)(ii) of Directive 2013/36/EU,	the  institution        should  provide  the  following  information:          	1
46.In accordance with Article 92(1), in conjunction with Article 95(1) of the CRD, all institutions    which are themselves significant, considering the individual, parent company	and  group  level,        must  establish  a  remuneration  committee.  Subsidiaries  which  are  regulated  by  specific        sectoral  legislation  (e.g.  AIFMs  or  UCITS  managers)  should  follow  the  rules  set  out  in  the        specific  sectoral  legislation  applying  to  them  in  order  to  determine  whether  or  not  they  are        required  to  establish  a  remuneration  committee.  The  consolidating  institution  should  ensure        that  a  remuneration  committee  is  established  when  legally  required.            	1
47.Where a remuneration committee is established in a non-significant institution, the institutio	n    should comply with the requirements of these guidelines concerning the remuneration 	1
48.Where no remuneration committee is established, the requirements of these guidelines    concerning the remuneration committee should be construed as applying to the supervisory 	    function.          	1
49.The remuneration committee should be composed of members of the supervisory function 16    who do not perform executive functions. The chair and the majority	of  members  of  the        remuneration  committee  should  qualify  as  independent  17.  If  employee  representation  on  the        management  body  is  provided  for  by  national  law,  it  must  include  one  or  more  employee        representatives.  Where  there  are  not  a  sufficient  number  of  qualified  independent  members,        institutions  should  implement  other  measures  within  the  remuneration  policy  to  limit  conflicts        of  interest  in  decisions  on  remuneration  issues.  	1
50.Members of the remuneration committee should have collectively appropriate knowledge,    expertise and professional experience concerning remuneration policies and practices, risk    management	and  control  activities,  namely  with  regard  to  the  mechanism  for  aligning  the        remuneration  structure  to  institutions’  risk  and  capital  profiles.            	1
51.The remuneration             	 committee should:          	1
52.Where the institution has established a remuneration committee, the remuneration of the    senior officers in the independent control functions, including the risk management and	      compliance  functions,  should  be  directly  overseen  by  the  remuneration  committee.  The        remuneration  committee  should  make  recommendations  to  the  supervisory  function  on  the        design  of  the  remuneration  package  and  amounts  of  remuneration  to  be  paid  to  the  senior        staff  members  in  the  control  functions.    	1
53.The remuneratio              	n committee should:         	1
55.When established, the risk committee should, without prejudice to the tasks of the    remuneration committee, examine whether incentives provided by the remuneration policies 	    and  practices  take  into  consideration  the  institution’s  risk,  capital,  liquidity  and  the  likelihood        and  timing  of  earnings.              	1
56.A member of the risk committee should participate in the meetings of the remuneration    	committee, where both committees are established, and vice versa. 	1
57.The supervisory function or, where established, the remuneration committee should ensure    that the remuneration policy and practices of the institution are subject to a	central  and        independent  internal  review  at  least  annually.        	1
58.A central review of the compliance with the regulation, group policies, procedures and internal    rules should be performed by the internal audit function of	the  consolidating  institution.          	1
59.Institutions should perform the central and independent review on an individual basis. In a    group, non-significant institutions which are subsidiaries may rely on the	review  performed  by        the  consolidating  institution,  where  the  review  performed  on  the  consolidated  or  subconsolidated  basis  included  the  institution  and  where  the  results  are  made  available  to  the        supervisory  function  of  that  institution.        	1
60.The periodic independent review of remuneration policies may be, partially or totally,    externally outsourced by small and less complex institutions. Larger and more complex	      institutions  should  have  sufficient  resources  to  conduct  the  review  internally.  Qualified  and        independent  external  consultants  18  may  complement  and  support  the  institution  in  carrying        out  such  tasks.  The  supervisory  function  is  responsible  for  the  review.            	1
61.As part of the central and independent internal review, institutions should assess whether the	    overall remuneration policies, practices and processes:    	1
62.The other relevant internal corporate functions (i.e. human resources, legal, strategic planning,    etc.), as well as other key supervisory function committees (i.e. audit, risk	and  nominations        committees),  should  be  closely  involved  in  reviewing  the  remuneration  policies  of  the        institution  in  order  to  assure  the  alignment  with  the  institutions’  risk  management  strategy        and  framework.          	1
63.Where periodic reviews reveal that the remuneration policies do not operate as intended or    prescribed or where recommendations are made, the remuneration committee, where	      established,  or  the  supervisory  function,  should  ensure  that  a  remedial  action  plan  is        proposed,  approved  and  timeously  implemented.          	1
64.The results of the performed internal review and actions taken to remedy any findings should    be documented, either through written reports or through the	minutes  of  the  meeting  of  the        relevant  committees  or  the  supervisory  function,  and  made  available  to  the  management        body,  relevant  committees  and  corporate  functions.            	1
65.In accordance with Articles 92(1) and 109 of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions must comply    with all requirements of Articles 92(2), 93 94 95 and 96	of  that  Directive,  including  the        applicable  Regulatory  Technical  Standards  regarding  remuneration,  at  the  consolidated,  subconsolidated  (including  subsidiaries  and  branches  in  third  countries)  and  individual  level.  With        regard  to  the  individual  level,  competent  authorities  may  make  use  of  the  derogation  provided        for  in  Article  7  of  the  CRR  in  accordance  with  Article  109(1)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.  It  is  the        institutions’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  internal  remuneration  policies  comply  with  any        specific  requirements  regarding  activities  performed  in  any  relevant  jurisdiction.          	1
66.At the consolidated or sub-consolidated level, the consolidating institution and competent    authorities should ensure that a group-wide remuneration policy is implemented and  	  complied  with  for:        	1
67.Regarding institutions and entities within a group located in more than one Member State, the    group-wide remuneration policy should specify how its implementation should	deal  with  19            Regarding  the  identification  process  in  a  group  context  please  refer  to  section5.    	1
68.In accordance with Articles 92(1) and 109 of Directive 2013/36/EU the consolidating institution    must ensure that subsidiaries that fall into the scope of prudential	consolidation,  but  which  are        not  themselves  subject  to  Directive  2013/36/EU,  have  remuneration  policies  that  are        consistent  with  the  group-wide  remuneration  policy  for  all  staff  and  comply  with  the        requirements  of  Articles  92(2),  93  and  94  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  at  least  for  those  identified        staff  whose  professional  activities  have  a  material  impact  on  the  group’s  risk  profile.  This  also        applies  to  specific  requirements  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  which  have  not  been  included  in        other  sectoral  legislation  (e.g.  for  staff  whose  professional  activities  have  a  material  impact  on        the  group’s  risk  profile,  but  who  are  staff  of  entities  that  fall  within  the  scope  of        Directive  2011/61/EU  23  and  Directive  2009/65/EC  24  the  consolidation  institution  must  ensure        that  the  limitation  of  the  variable  components  of  remuneration  to  100,00 %  (if  applicable,  up  to        200,00 %  with  shareholders’  approval)  of  the  fixed  components  of  remuneration  is  complied        with).  25  Where  specific  requirements  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  conflict  with  the  sectoral        requirements  (e.g.  under  Directive  2011/61/EU  or  Directive  2009/65/EC),  the  specific  sectoral        legislation  should  prevail  (e.g.  entities  subject  to  Directive  2011/61/EU  or        Directive  2009/65/EC  should  pay  the  variable  remuneration  of  identified  staff  whose        professional  activities  have  a  material  impact  on  the  group’s  risk  profile  in  units  or  shares  of        the  alternative  investment  fund  concerned  or  units  of  the  UCITS  concerned  (Annex  II(1)(m)  of        Directive  2011/61/EU  and  Article  14(b)(m)  of  Directive  2009/65/EC,  respectively)).	1
69.Staff seconded from a parent undertaking in a third country to an EU subsidiary that is an    institution or a branch who, were they	employed  directly  by  the  EU  institution  or  branch,        would  fall  into  the  scope  of  identified  staff  of  that  EU  institution  or  branch,  are  identified  staff.        Such  seconded  staff  should  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Articles  92  93  and  94  of        Directive  2013/36/EU  as  they  are  implemented  in  the  Member  State  where  the  EU  institution        or  branch  is  established  and  applicable  Regulatory  Technical  Standards.  For  the  purposes  of        short-term  secondments,  for  example  where  a  person  is  only  residing  in  a  Member  State  for  a        few  weeks  to  carry  out  project  work,  that  person  should  be  subject  to  such  provisions  only  if  20    Article  94(1)(g)(i)  and  (ii)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.  21    Article  94(1)(g)(iii)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.  22    Article  94(1)(l)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU.  23      Directive  2011/61/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  8  June  2011  on  Alternative  Investment  Fund  Managers  and  amending  Directives  2003/41/EC  and  2009/65/EC  and  Regulations  (EC)  No  1060/2009  and  (EU)  No  1095/2010  (OJ  L  174  1.7.2011,  p.  1).  24      Directive  2009/65/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  13  July  2009  on  the  coordination  of  laws,  regulations  and  administrative  provisions  relating  to  undertakings  for  collective  investment  in  transferable  securities  (UCITS)  (OJ  L  302  17.11.2009,  p.  32).  25      Further  details  on  how  to  identify  these  staff  members  are  set  out  under  section  5.3,  ‘Identification  process  on  solo  and  consolidated  level’,  below.              	1
70.Short-term contracts or secondments must not be used as a means of circumventing the    remuneration requirements of Directive 2013/36/EU and any related standards or	guidelines.              	1
71.Regarding subsidiaries established in third countries that are included in the scope of    prudential consolidation of a consolidating institution in a Member State, the	group-wide        remuneration  policy  should  set  the  maximum  level  of  the  ratio  between  the  variable        component  of  remuneration  and  the  fixed  component  not  higher  than  100,00 %  (if  applicable,  up        to  200,00 %  with  shareholders’  approval  at  the  group  level),  specify  whether  the  notional  discount        rate  is  applied  and  ensure  that  for  the  pay  out  of  variable  remuneration  instruments  are  used        in  line  with  these  guidelines  and  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  527/2014  26.            	1
72.A subsidiary established in a third country that is included in the scope of prudential    consolidation of a consolidating institution in a Member State	should  have  remuneration        policies  that  are  consistent  with  the  group-wide  remuneration  policy  and  comply  with  the        requirements  of  Articles  92(2),  93  and  94  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  at  least  for  those  staff        whose  professional  activities  have  a  material  impact  on  the  group’s  risk  profile.          	1
73.Competent authorities should ensure that branches in a Member State of credit institutions    authorised in a third country are subject to the same requirements	as  applicable  to  institutions        within  Member  States.  Where  these  branches  want  to  implement  a  ratio  between  the  variable        and  fixed  components  of  remuneration  higher  than  100%,  they  should  demonstrate  to  the        competent  authority  that  the  shareholders  of  the  institution  in  the  third  country  have        approved  the  higher  ratio.        	1
74.The remuneration requirements of Directive 2013/36/EU and these guidelines apply to    institutions independent of the fact that they may be subsidiaries of a parent	institution  in  a        third  country.  Where  an  EU  subsidiary  of  an  parent  institution  in  a  third  country  is  a        consolidating  institution,  the  scope  of  prudential  consolidation  does  not  include  the  level  of        the  parent  institution  located  in  a  third  country  and  other  direct  subsidiaries  of  that  parent        institution.  The  consolidating  institution  should  ensure  that  the  group-wide  remuneration        policy  of  the  parent  institution  in  a  third  country  is  taken  into  consideration  within  its  own        remuneration  policies  as  far  as  this  is  not  contrary  to  the  requirements  set  out  under  relevant        EU  or  national  law,  including  these  guidelines.      	1
4.       Proportionality 26    Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 527/2014 of 12 March 2014 supplementing Directive (EU) No 2013/36/EU	of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  with  regard  to  regulatory  technical  standards  specifying  the  classes  of  instruments  that  adequately  reflect  the  credit  quality  of  an  institution  as  a  going  concern  and  are  appropriate  to  be  used  for  the  purposes  of  variable  remuneration  (OJ  L  148  20.5.2014,  p.  21).  It  is  published  under:  http://eurlex  .europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2014_148_R_0006  	1
75.The proportionality principle encoded in Article 92(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU aims to match    remuneration policies and practices consistently with the individual risk profile, risk	appetite        and  strategy  of  an  institution,  so  that  the  objectives  of  the  obligations  are  effectively  achieved.      	1
76.In assessing the application of the requirements in a proportionate manner, institutions and    competent authorities should consider a combination of all the following criteria:	the  size,  the        internal  organisation  and  the  nature,  scope  and  complexity  of  the  institution’s  activities.        	1
77.For these purposes, institutions and competent authorities should take into account at least	    the following criteria:        	1
78.When applying requirements in a proportionate way, institutions are responsible to consider    their risk profile, risk appetite and other characteristics and to develop and	implement        remuneration  policies  and  practices  which  are  appropriately  aligned  to  the  business  strategy,            	1
79.Before remuneration requirements are applied in a proportionate way, the identification of    staff, based on the criteria provided in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No	604/2014        and  additional  internal  criteria,  should  be  performed  27.  The  limitation  of  the  maximum  ratio        between  the  variable  components  of  remuneration  and  the  fixed  components  to  100,00 %  (200%        with  shareholders’  approval)  should  be  applied  to  all  identified  staff  in  the  institution  and,        regarding  its  subsidiaries  that  are  in  the  scope  of  prudential  consolidation,  to  the  identified        staff  that  has  an  impact  on  the  group  risk  profile,  even  if  they  are  not  themselves  subject  to        Directive  2013/36/EU,  in  line  with  the  guidelines  in  section  3.        	1
80.When implementing specific remuneration policies for different categories of identified staff in    line with sections 3 and 4 of these guidelines, the application of	proportionality  should  take        into  account  the  impact  on  the  institution’s  risk  profile  of  that  category  of  identified  staff.  	1
81.Competent authorities should ensure that institutions comply with the remuneration    requirements in a manner that provides for an equivalent level of conditions for competition	      between  the  same  categories  of  institutions.            	1
82.According to the above, large (including significant) and more complex institutions and groups    should have more sophisticated remuneration policies and risk measurement approaches, 	    while  small  and  less  complex  institutions  and  groups  may  implement  simpler  remuneration        policies  and  approaches.    	1
83.It is the responsibility of institutions to identify the members of staff whose professional    activities have a material impact on the institution’s risk profile.	All  institutions  should  conduct        annually  a  self-assessment  in  order  to  identify  all  staff  whose  professional  activities  have  or        may  have  a  material  impact  on  the  institution’s  risk  profile.  The  identification  process  should        be  part  of  the  overall  remuneration  policy  of  the  institution.            	1
84.The self-assessment should be based on the qualitative and quantitative criteria set out in    Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 and should include, where	needed  to        ensure  the  complete  identification  of  all  staff  whose  professional  activities  have  a  material        impact  on  the  institution’s  risk  profile,  additional  criteria  set  forth  by  the  institution  that  reflect        the  levels  of  risk  of  different  activities  within  the  institution  and  the  impact  of  staff  members        on  the  risk  profile.    	1
85.In accordance with Article 4 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 regarding    the quantitative criteria, the total remuneration awarded to staff in the	preceding  financial        year  should  be  taken  into  account  to  ensure  that  the  identification  can  be  performed  at  the        beginning  of  the  following  financial  year.  When  applying  the  quantitative  criteria  of        Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014,  institutions  should  take  into  account  all        monetary  and  non-monetary  fixed  and  variable  remuneration  components  awarded  for        professional  services  in  the  preceding  financial  year.  For  the  fixed  component  these  are  the        amounts  that  have  been  awarded  and  usually  paid  out  in  the  preceding  financial  year.  For  the        variable  component  these  are  the  amounts  that  have  been  awarded  in  the  preceding  financial        year  for  the  complete  previous  accrual  period,  independent  of  the  fact  that  only  parts  of  the        variable  remuneration  were  paid  out  in  the  preceding  financial  year  and  other  parts  were        deferred.  28  Routine  remuneration  packages  that  are  not  accounted  for  on  an  individual  level        should  be  taken  into  account  based  on  the  overall  sum  broken  down  by  objective  criteria  to        the  individual  staff  member.  	1
86.Institutions which award remuneration in a currency other than the euro should convert the    thresholds set out in Article 4 of Commission Delegated Regulation	604/2014  as  set  out  in        Article  5  of  that  Regulation  using  either  the  internal  exchange  rate  used  for  the  consolidation        of  the  accounts  or  the  exchange  rate  used  by  the  Commission  for  financial  programming  and        the  budget  for  the  month  where  the  remuneration  was  awarded  29.    	1
87.Where institutions apply Article 5(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014,    they should assign all staff active in entities in the scope of	prudential  consolidation  to  the        country  where  the  individual  exercises  his  or  her  predominant  activity  and  apply  the  criteria  in        Article  4(1)(b)  and  (c)  on  a  country  by  country  basis  to  the  staff  assigned  to  a  specific  country.              	1
88.Where the quantitative criteria are met, staff are identified staff, unless the institution applies    Article 4(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014. In	relation  to  criterion  (a),        in  respect  of  staff  who  were  awarded  total  remuneration  of  EUR  750  0  or  more  in  the        preceding  financial  year,  or  (b)  of  Article  (4)(1)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)        No  604/2014,  the  application  of  paragraph  -2  of  Article  4  of  that  Regulation  is  subject  to  the        prior  approval  of  the  competent  authority.    	1
89.The self-assessment should be clear, consistent, properly documented and periodically    updated during the year at least with regard to the criteria under Article 3	of  Commission        Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014.  Institutions  should  ensure  that  staff  that  fall  or  are        likely  to  fall  under  the  criteria  in  Article  3  for  a  period  of  at  least  three  months  in  a  financial        year  are  treated  as  identified  staff.            	1
90.The following information should at least be included in t	he documentation of the selfassessment done regarding the identification of staff:       	1
91.Institutions should keep records of the identification process and its results and should be able    to demonstrate to their competent supervisory authority how staff	have  been  identified        according  to  both  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  criteria  provided  for  in  Commission        Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014  and  any  additional  criteria  used  by  the  institutions.    	1
92.The documentation of the self-assessment should at least include the number of identified    staff including the number of staff identified for the first time,	the  job  responsibilities  and        activities,  the  names  or  another  unique  identifier  and  the  allocation  within  the  institution  of        the  identified  staff  to  business  areas  and  a  comparison  with  the  results  of  the  previous  year’s        self-assessment.            	1
93.The documentation should also include staff members who have been identified under    quantitative criteria, but whose professional activities are assessed as not having a	material        impact  on  the  institution’s  risk  profile,  in  accordance  with  Article  4  of  Commission  Delegated        Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014.  Those  assessments  should  be  properly  documented,  including        the  rationale  underpinning  the  applied  exclusions.  Institutions  should  maintain  the        documentation  for  an  appropriate  time  period  to  enable  the  review  by  the  competent        authorities.            	1
94.Where the institution determines according to Article 4(2) of Commission Delegated    Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 that the professional activities of the staff member do	not  have  a        material  impact  on  the  institution’s  risk  profile  and  notifies  the  competent  authority  or  applies        for  a  prior  approval,  the  following  should  apply:          	1
95.The prior approval under Article 4(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014    regarding exclusions of staff identified in relation to the criterion in	point  (b)  of  Article  4(1)  of        that  Regulation  should  be  granted  only  for  a  limited  time  period.  The  request  for  prior        approval  under  Article  4(5)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014  should  be        made  each  year.  With  respect  to  staff  for  whom  a  decision  on  the  application  is  taken  for  the        first  time,  the  prior  approval  should  only  concern  the  financial  year  in  which  the  prior  approval        was  requested  and  the  following  financial  year.  For  staff  for  whom  the  application  of  Article        4(2)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014  has  already  been  approved  for  the        ongoing  financial  year,  the  prior  approval  should  only  concern  the  following  financial  year.      	1
96.The notification of the application of exclusions under Article 4(4) of Commission Delegated    Regulation (EU) No 604/2014, for staff identified in relation to the	criterion  in  point  (a)  of        Article  4(1)  of  that  Regulation,  should  be  made  annually,  differentiating  between  exclusions  in        relation  to  the  criteria  in  points  (a)  and  (b)  of  Article  4(2)  of  that  Regulation,  but  limited  to  staff        who  were  not  notified  as  being  excluded  in  the  previous  accrual  period  in  relation  to  the  same        criterion  (e.g.  where  a  staff  member  was  excluded  as  the  business  unit  is  not  material  no        notification  is  needed  when  the  same  staff  member  would  still  be  active  in  the  same  business        unit  and  the  business  unit  is  still  not  material).              	1
97.Where identified staff would be excluded in subsidiaries which are not themselves subject to    Directive 2013/36/EU, the competent authority is the competent authority of	the  parent        institution.  For  branches  of  credit  institutions  where  the  head  office  is  located  in  a  third        country  the  competent  authority  is  the  competent  authority  responsible  for  the  supervision  of        institutions  in  the  Member  State  where  the  branch  is  located.  	1
98. Notifications and requests for prior approval should include all names or another unique    identifier for identified staff for whom an exclusion should apply,	the  percentage  of  internal        capital  allocated  in  accordance  with  Article  73  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  to  the  business  unit  in        which  the  staff  member  is  active  in  and  where  required  under  Commission  Delegated        Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014  the  analysis  of  the  impact  of  staff  on  the  institution’s  risk  profile        for  each  identified  staff  member.  Where  identified  staff  are  active  in  the  same  business  unit        and  have  the  same  function  a  joint  assessment  should  be  made.      	1
99.The management body has the ultimate responsibility for the identification process and the  	  respective policy. The management body in its supervisory function should: 	1
100. Where a remuneration committee is established, it should be actively involved in the    identification process in line with its responsibilities for the preparation	of  decisions  regarding        remuneration.  Where  no  remuneration  committee  is  established,  the  non-executive  and        where  possible  the  independent  members  of  the  management  body  in  its  supervisory  function        should  execute  the  respective  tasks.      	1
101. The independent risk management and independent compliance functions, the business    support functions (e.g. legal, human resources) and the relevant committees of the 	    management  body  (i.e.  risk,  nomination  and  audit  committees)  should  be  involved  in  the    43  GUIDELINES  ON  SOUND  REMUNERATION  POLICIES              	1
102. The criteria included in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 and those    additionally set by the institutions should be applied both by institutions	on  a  solo  basis,  using        the  figures  and  considering  the  situation  of  the  individual  institution,  and  in  addition  by  the        consolidating  institution  on  a  consolidated  and  sub-consolidated  basis  as  defined  in  points  -48        and  -49  of  Article  4(1)  CRR,  including  also  all  subsidiaries  in  the  scope  of  prudential        consolidation  which  are  not  themselves  subject  to  CRD,  using  the  consolidated  figures  and        considering  the  consolidated  situation  and  the  impact  on  the  institutions’  risk  profile  on  a        consolidated  basis.  The  same  applies  for  the  sub-consolidated  level.        	1
103. When applying the qualitative criteria in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation    (EU) No 604/2014 at consolidated or sub-consolidated level, staff members in	a  subsidiary  are        only  captured  if  they  are  responsible  for  the  functions  referred  to  in  these  criteria  on  a        consolidated  or  sub-consolidated  basis.  E.g.  a  staff  member  in  a  subsidiary  who  is  a  member  of        the  management  body  of  such  subsidiary  should  be  captured  by  the  criterion  set  out  in        Article  3(1)  of  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No  604/2014  (‘the  staff  member  is  a        member  of  the  management  body  in  its  management  function’)  only  if  he  or  she  is  also  a        member  of  the  management  body  of  the  EU  parent  institution.        	1
104. The quantitative criteria within Article 4 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)    No 604/2014 apply to all staff on a consolidated and sub-consolidated basis,	including  all        subsidiaries  in  the  scope  of  the  prudential  consolidation.  E.g.  staff  in  a  subsidiary  earning        EUR  500  0  or  more  are  therefore  considered  identified  staff,  unless  they  would  be  excluded        under  Article  4  (paragraphs  2  to  5)  of  these  RTS.              	1
105. When applying the qualitative criteria in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation    (EU) No 604/2014 on the solo level, institutions should identify the	staff  responsible  for  the        function  named  in  the  qualitative  criteria;  the  main  criterion  for  the  identification  is  not  the        name  of  the  function  but  the  authority  and  responsibility  conferred  on  the  function.          	1
106. The consolidating institution should ensure the overall consistency of the group    remuneration policies including the identification processes and the correct implementation  	  on  a  consolidated,  sub-consolidated  and  solo  basis.              	1
107. Institutions that are subsidiaries of a consolidating institution should implement within    their remuneration policy the policy issued by the consolidating parent institution and	the        process  for  the  identification  of  staff.  All  subsidiaries  should  actively  participate  in  the        identification  process  carried  out  by  the  consolidating  parent  institution.  In  particular,  each        subsidiary  in  the  scope  of  prudential  consolidation,  including  those  not  themselves  subject  to        Directive  2013/36/EU,  should  provide  the  consolidating  institution  with  all  information        necessary  to  properly  identify  all  staff  who  have  a  material  impact  on  the  institutions’  risk        profile  on  a  consolidated  or  sub-consolidated  basis.      	1
108. Subsidiaries that are not themselves subject to Directive 2013/36/EU are not required to    perform an identification process on the solo level. For those	subsidiaries  the  assessment        should  be  performed  by  the  consolidating  institution,  based  on  information  provided  by  the        subsidiary.  Institutions  falling  within  the  scope  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  (credit  institutions  and        investment  firms)  should  conduct  their  own  self-assessment  for  the  identification  of  staff  on        the  solo  level.  Small  and  less  complex  institutions  which  are  included  in  an  identification        process  on  a  consolidated  basis  may  delegate  the  practical  application  of  the  identification        process  on  a  solo  level  to  the  consolidating  institution.        	1
109. Institutions and competent authorities should ensure that the award, pay out and vesting    of variable remuneration, including the application of malus and clawback	arrangements,        under  the  institutions’  remuneration  policy  is  not  detrimental  to  maintaining  a  sound  capital        base.  	1
110. When assessing if the capital basis is sound, the institution should take into account its    overall own funds and in particular the Common	Equity  Tier  1  capital,  the  combined  capital        buffer  requirement  as  defined  in  Article  128(6)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  and  the  restrictions  on        distributions  set  out  in  Article  141  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  which  applies  to  the  variable        remuneration  of  all  staff  as  well  as  the  result  of  the  internal  capital  adequacy  assessment        process.  The  requirements  to  maintain  the  combined  capital  buffer  set  out  in  Article  129  of        Directive  2013/36/EU,  including  the  restrictions  on  distributions  set  out  in  Article  141(2)  and        -3  of  that  Directive,  apply  also  on  a  consolidated  and  sub-consolidated  basis.  Additionally,        	1
111. Institutions should include the impact of variable remuneration - both upfront and    deferred amounts - in their capital and liquidity planning and in	their  overall  internal  capital        adequacy  assessment  process.          	1
112. The total variable remuneration awarded by an institution must not limit the ability of the    institution to maintain or restore a sound capital	base  in  the  long  term  and  should  consider  the        interests  of  shareholders  and  owners,  depositors,  investors  and  other  stakeholders.  Variable        remuneration  should  not  be  awarded  or  paid  out  when  the  effect  would  be  that  the  capital        base  of  the  institution  would  no  longer  be  sound.  In  addition  to  the  restrictions  on        distributions  set  out  in  Article  141  of  Directive  2013/36/EU,  the  institution  should  consider        these  requirements  when  determining:    	1
113. Institutions which do not have a sound capital basis or where the soundness of the capital    base is at risk should take the	following  measures  with  regard  to  variable  remuneration:  	1
114. Competent authorities should intervene where the awarding of variable remuneration is    detrimental to the maintenance of a sound capital base by requiring the	institution  to  reduce        or  apply  a  cap  to  the  overall  pool  of  variable  remuneration  determined  until  the  capital        adequacy  situation  improves;  and  if  necessary  to  apply  performance  adjustment  measures,  in        particular  malus  and  require  institutions  to  use  nets  profits  to  strengthen  own  funds.          	1
115. Under Directive 2013/36/EU, remuneration is either fixed or variable remuneration; there    is no third category of remuneration. Where remuneration is variable and is	paid  to  identified        staff,  all  requirements  of  Article  94  of  CRD  have  also  to  be  met  in  addition  to  the  general        requirements  contained  in  Article  92  thereof.  For  that  purpose,  institutions  should  allocate  in        line  with  these  guidelines  the  components  of  remuneration  to  either  fixed  or  variable        remuneration  and  their  remuneration  policies  should  set  out  clear,  objective,  predetermined        and  transparent  criteria  to  assign  all  remuneration  components  to  either  the  fixed  or  variable        categories  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  provided  in  Article  92(2)(g)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU        and  these  guidelines.        	1
116. Where the clear allocation of a component to the fixed remuneration is not possible    based on the criteria provided in these guidelines, it	should  be  considered  as  variable        remuneration.            	1
117.    Remuneration is fixed where the conditions      	 for its award and its amount:     	1
118. Remuneration components that are either part of a general institution-wide policy where    they meet the conditions listed in paragraph 117 or payments mandatory	under  national  law,        are  considered  as  fixed  remuneration.  This  includes  payments  which  form  part  of  routine        employment  packages  as  defined  in  these  guidelines.              	1
119. The following remuneration components should also be considered as fixed, where all    	similar situations are treated in a consistent way:   	1
120. The variable and fixed remuneration of institutions may consist of different elements,    including additional or ancillary payments or benefits. Institutions should analyse allowances	31        and  allocate  them  to  the  variable  or  fixed  component  of  remuneration.  The  allocation  should        be  based  on  the  criteria  in  section  7.              	1
121. In particular where allowances are considered as fixed remuneration, but show any of the    following features, the institution should duly document the results	of  the  assessments  made        under  section  07:00:00          	1
122. Where allowances are based on the role, function or organisational responsibility of staff,    in order to be correctly mapped to the fixed component	of  remuneration  they  should  meet  the        criteria  set  out  in  paragraph  117  taking  into  account  all  of  the  following  particulars:            	1
123. Competent authorities should ensure that allowances are not a vehicle or method that    	facilitates the non-compliance of institutions with the CRD.  	1
124. When the award of variable remuneration, including LTIPs, is based on past performance    of at least one year, but also depends on future	performance  conditions,  the  following  should        apply:            	1
125. Where a prospective remuneration plan for variable remuneration, including LTIPs, is    exclusively based on future performance conditions (e.g. where new staff receive an	LTIP  at        the  beginning  of  the  first  year  of  employment),  the  amount  should  be  considered  as  awarded        after  the  performance  conditions  have  been  met,  otherwise  no  award  should  be  made.        Awarded  amounts  should  be  taken  into  account  for  the  calculation  of  the  ratio  between  the        variable  and  the  fixed  component  of  the  total  remuneration  in  the  financial  year  prior  to  their        award.  Where  a  specific  number  of  instruments  are  awarded,  they  should  exceptionally  be        valued  for  the  purpose  of  the  calculation  of  the  ratio  between  the  variable  and  the  fixed        component  of  the  total  remuneration  with  the  market  price  or  fair  value  determined  at  the        time  the  prospective  remuneration  plan  for  variable  remuneration  was  granted.  Points  (a)  to            	1
126. ‘Carried interest’ payments within the meaning of Article 4(1)(d) of the AIFMD are subject    to the remuneration provisions of the AIFMD; paragraph 2	of  Annex  I  of  the  AIFMD  specifically        includes  carried  interest  in  the  definition  of  remuneration33.  The  ESMA  guidelines  on  sound        remuneration  policies  under  the  AIFMD  apply  34.  For  the  purposes  of  these  EBA  guidelines  and        in  particular  of  calculating  the  ratio  between  the  variable  and  fixed  components  of        remuneration  for  staff  identified  under  section  13  of  these  guidelines,  the  following  should        apply:  	1
127. Dividends paid on vested shares or equivalent ownership interests that staff receive as    shareholders or owners of an institution, are not part of	remuneration  for  the  purpose  of        these  guidelines.  However,  such  payments  must  not  be  used  as  a  payment  method  for  variable        remuneration  which  would  lead  to  a  circumvention  of  the  remuneration  requirements        established  by  the  CRD.            	1
128. Institutions should be able to substantiate their legitimate interest in awarding retention    bonuses to retain an identified staff member. For example, retention bonuses	may  be  used        under  restructurings,  in  wind-down  or  after  a  change  of  control.            	1
129. A retention bonus must comply with the requirements on variable remuneration,    including the ex post risk alignment, payment in instruments, deferral, retention, malus	and        clawback.  Retention  bonuses  are  based  not  on  performance,  but  on  other  conditions  (i.e.  the        circumstance  that  the  staff  member  stays  in  the  institutions  for  a  predetermined  period  of        time  or  until  a  certain  event),  hence  ex  ante  risk  adjustments  are  not  necessary.          	1
130. Retention bonuses should not be awarded to merely compensate 	for performancerelated remuneration not paid due to insufficient performance or the institution’s financial    situation.	1
131. Institutions should set the retention period as a specific period of time or by defining an    event when the retention condition should be	met.  The  retention  bonuses  should  be  awarded        after  the  retention  period  ends  or  the  retention  condition  is  met.  	1
132. A retention bonus should be taken into account within the calculation of the ratio    between the variable and the fixed remuneration as variable	remuneration.  The  retention        bonus  should  be  taken  into  account  either  with  an  annual  amount  in  each  year  of  the        retention  period  which  is  calculated  on  a  linear  pro  rata  basis  independent  of  the  fact  that  the        full  amount  is  awarded  after  the  end  of  the  retention  period,  or  with  the  full  amount  when  the        retention  condition  is  met.  Where  the  exact  length  of  the  retention  period  is  not  known        upfront,  the  institution  should  set  and  duly  document  a  period  considering  the  situation  and        measures  taken  that  justify  the  payment  of  a  retention  bonus.  The  calculation  of  the  ratio        should  be  based  on  the  period  set.  	1
133. Discretionary pension benefits are a form of variable remuneration. Where the terms of    the company’s pension scheme include pension benefits that are not	based  on  performance        and  which  are  consistently  granted  to  a  category  of  staff,  such  pension  benefits  should  not  be        considered  discretionary,  but  should  be  considered  as  part  of  routine  employment  packages  in        line  with  the  Section  of  these  guidelines  on  definitions.              	1
134. The institution should ensure that where a staff member leaves the institution or retires    discretionary pension benefits are not paid without the consideration	of  the  economic        situation  of  the  institution  or  risks  that  have  been  taken  by  the  staff  member  which  can  affect        the  institution  in  the  long  term.        	1
135. The full amount of discretionary pension benefits must be awarded, in accordance with    Article 94(1)(o) of the CRD, in instruments referred to in	point  (l)  of  this  article  and:    	1
136. Institutions should ensure that malus and clawback arrangements are applied in the same    way to discretionary pension benefits as to other elements of	variable  remuneration.            	1
137. Guaranteed variable remuneration can take several forms such as a ‘guaranteed bonus‘,    ‘welcome bonus‘, ‘sign-on bonus‘, ‘minimum bonus‘, etc., and can be awarded	either  in  cash        or  in  instruments.            	1
138. When awarding guaranteed variable remuneration in accordance with Article 94(1)(d)    and (e) of Directive 2013/36/EU when hiring new staff, institutions are not permitted	to        guarantee  variable  remuneration  for  longer  than  the  first  year  of  employment.  Guaranteed        variable  remuneration  is  exceptional  and  can  only  occur  where  the  institution  has  a  sound  and        strong  capital  base,  in  accordance  with  Article  94(1)(e)  of  that  Directive  and  section  6  of  these        guidelines.              	1
139. Institutions should only award once to the same single staff member guaranteed variable    remuneration. This requirement should also apply at a consolidated and	sub-consolidated  level        and  includes  situations  where  staff  receive  a  new  contract  from  the  same  institution  or        another  institution  within  the  scope  of  consolidation.              	1
140. Institutions and competent authorities may not include the amount of guaranteed    variable remuneration in the calculation of the ratio between the fixed and	variable        components  of  the  total  remuneration  for  the  first  performance  period,  where  the  guaranteed        variable  remuneration  is  awarded  when  hiring  new  staff  before  the  first  performance  period        starts.            	1
141. As part of the arrangements guaranteeing this part of variable remuneration, institutions    may not apply the requirements on malus and clawback arrangements to	guaranteed  variable        remuneration.  Institutions  may  pay  out  the  full  amount  in  non-deferred  cash.            	1
142. The compensation for the buyout of a previous contract should be awarded under the 	   conditions defined in paragraph 138 of these guidelines. 	1
143. Remuneration should be considered as being granted as compensation or for the buyout    of a previous contract where the deferred variable remuneration of	the  staff  member  was        reduced  or  revoked  by  the  previous  employer  because  of  the  termination  of  the  contract.  For        remuneration  packages  relating  to  compensation  or  buyout  from  contracts  in  previous        employment,  all  requirements  for  variable  remuneration  apply,  including  deferral,  retention,        pay  out  in  instruments  and  clawback  arrangements.          	1
144. Institutions’ remuneration policies should specify the possible use of severance payments,    including the maximum amount or criteria for the determination of such amounts	that  can  be        awarded  as  severance  pay  to  identified  staff.  Regular  remuneration  payments  related  to  the        duration  of  a  notice  period  should  not  be  considered  as  severance  payments.    	1
145. Institutions should have a framework in which severance pay is determined and    approved, including a clear allocation of the responsibilities and decision-making powers	and        the  procedural  involvement  of  the  control  functions.        	1
146. Severance payments should not provide for a disproportionate reward, but for an    appropriate compensation of the staff member in cases of early termination	of  the  contract.  In        accordance  with  Article  94(1)(h)  of  Directive  2013/36/EU  severance  payments  must  reflect        performance  achieved  over  time  and  must  not  reward  failure  or  misconduct.        	1
147. Severance pay should not be awarded where there is an obvious failure which allows for    the immediate cancellation of the contract or the	dismissal  of  staff.          	1
148. Severance pay should not be awarded where a staff member resigns voluntarily in order    to take up a position in a different legal	entity,  unless  a  severance  payment  is  required  by        national  labour  law.  	1
149. Severance payments may include redundancy remuneration for loss of office, and may be    subject to a non-competition clause in the contract. In particular,	in  the  following  situations,        additional  payments  made,  because  of  the  early  termination  of  a  contract,  should  be        considered  as  severance  payment:    	1
150. Where institutions award severance pay, the institutions should be able to demonstrate    to the competent authority the reasons for the severance payment, the	appropriateness  of  the        amount  awarded  and  the  criteria  used  to  determine  the  amount,  including  that  it  is  linked  to        the  performance  achieved  over  time  and  that  it  does  not  reward  failure  or  misconduct.        	1
151. When determining the amount of severance payments to be made, the institution should    take into account the performance achieved over time and assess	where  relevant  the  severity        of  any  failure.  Identified  failures  should  be  distinguished  between  failures  of  the  institution        and  failures  of  the  identified  staff  as  follows:          	1
153. Failures of identified staff should be assessed 	 on a case-by-case basis, and includes the    following situations:      	1
154. Severance payments should be considered as variable remuneration. The following    amounts of severance payments should not be taken into account for the purpose	of  the        calculation  of  that  ratio  and  for  the  application  of  deferral  and  the  pay  out  in  instruments:  	1
155. When calculating the ratio between the variable and the fixed components of the total    remuneration the following amounts of severance pay should be	taken  into  account  as        variable  remuneration  for  the  purpose  of  the  calculation  of  that  ratio  for  the  last  performance        period:      	1
156. Where an appropriate remuneration policy is aligned with risks it should be sufficiently    effective and able to result in practice in a downward	adjustment  to  the  amount  of  variable        remuneration  awarded  to  staff  and  the  application  of  malus  and  clawback  arrangements.  	1
157. Institutions should ensure to the extent possible that identified staff members are not    able to transfer the downside risks of variable remuneration to	another  party  through  hedging        or  certain  types  of  insurance,  e.g.  by  implementing  policies  for  dealing  in  financial  instruments        and  disclosure  requirements.    	1
158. Identified staff should be considered to have hedged the risk of a downward adjustment    in remuneration, if the identified staff member enters into	a  contract  with  a  third  party  or  the        institution  and  either  of  the  following  conditions  is  met:    	1
159. Identified staff should be considered to have insured the risk of a downward adjustment    where staff takes out an insurance contract with a	stipulation  to  compensate  them  in  the        event  of  a  downward  adjustment  in  remuneration.  This  should  in  general  not  prevent  taking        out  insurance  to  cover  personal  payments  such  as  healthcare  and  mortgage  instalments.          	1
160. The requirement to not use personal hedging strategies or insurance to undermine the    risk alignment effects embedded in their remuneration arrangements should apply	to  deferred        and  retained  variable  remuneration.            	1
161. Institutions should maintain effective arrangements to ensure that the identified staff    member complies with the requirements of this section. At least a declaration	of  selfcommitment  by  the  identified  staff  member  that  he  or  she  will  refrain  from  concluding        personal  hedging  strategies  or  insurances  for  the  purpose  of  undermining  the  risk  alignment        effects  is  necessary.  Institutions’  human  resources  or  internal  control  functions  should  perform        at  least  spot-check  inspections  of  the  compliance  with  this  declaration  with  regard  to  the        internal  custodianship  accounts.  Random  checks  should  at  least  include  the  internal        custodianship  accounts  of  identified  staff.  Notification  to  the  institution  of  any  custodial        accounts  outside  the  institution  should  also  be  made  mandatory.    	1
162. Institutions should ensure that variable remuneration is not paid through vehicles or    methods which aim at or effectively lead to non-compliance with remuneration	requirements        for  identified  staff  or,  where  such  requirements  are  applied  to  all  staff,  with  remuneration        	1
163. ‘Circumvention’ is the non-compliance with remuneration requirements and takes place if    an institution is actually not meeting the objective and purpose of requirements	when        considered  together,  while  formally  the  institution  complies  with  the  wording  of  the  single        remuneration  requirements.              	1
164.    Circumvention takes place 	 in the following circumstances, among others:             	1
165. Institutions should ensure that the method for measuring the performance has    appropriate controls to ensure that the award criteria cannot be manipulated. Where	such        controls  are  not  in  place  the  variable  remuneration  is  not  appropriately  linked  to  performance        and  the  remuneration  policy  is  not  appropriately  implemented  and  any  payment  of  variable        remuneration  can  lead  to  a  violation  of  regulatory  requirements.  Possible  manipulations        include,  for  instance,  courtesy  decisions  in  the  bilateral  performance  measurement  process,    	1
166. Institutions should not provide compensation for any reduction or restructuring of    variable remuneration, e.g. made in the context of recovery and resolution measures	or  other        exceptional  government  intervention,  in  later  years  or  by  other  payments,  vehicles  or        methods.  	1
167. Institutions should not create group structures or offshore entities or contracts with    persons that act on behalf of the institution in order to	manipulate  the  outcome  of  the        identification  process  and  to  circumvent  the  application  of  the  remuneration  requirements  to        staff  to  which  these  requirements  should  otherwise  apply.          	1

                    connections with other clients, as defined in the draft EBA guidelines,                     would give rise to significant complexity and heterogeneity, as it                     would depend on the judgement and capacity of the institution to                     identify the relationships between exposures. One respondent is of                     the view that related and administrative efforts would increase                     significantly, and would represent a disproportionate burden for                     smaller institutions in particular.	                                                                                                                                                           70 GUIDELINES ON STS CRITERIA FOR ABCP SECURITISATION	0
      (a)     interbank rates including the Libor, Euribor and other recognised benchmarks;	The guidelines are expected to achieve these objectives by making the options for resolving the credit institution in circumstances of systemic instability more feasible and credible. The implementation of measures that remove impediments to resolvability will ensure the preparedness of resolution authorities and the most cost-effective option for resolution, and will contribute to financial stability. Having chosen to define general principles to be met by all measures and specifying the measures in relation to the objectives of resolution should ensure a proportionate approach to resolvability. The provision of further guidance on liabilities expected to contribute to loss absorption and recapitalisation could provide more tailored measures in accordance with the preferred resolution strategy.	0

In order to perform supervisory assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and determine whether institutions’ ICAAP and ILAAP meet the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should have access to various ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific background information, including documents describing institutions’ internal policies and operations documents as well as other supporting documents evidencing the use of ICAAP and ILAAP in the risk management and strategic management decision making process of an institution.	0

   16. The disadvantage is that there is a risk that amendments to, or new, international        guidelines may not be consistent with the ESAs’ guidelines. This approach would        therefore mean reviewing and, where necessary, updating the guidelines periodically and        whenever international standard setters reconsider their guidance and standards.	        In the case of institutions that use the FIRB Approach the risk weight of defaulted          exposures is zero. However, the calculation of expected loss is based on a PD that is equal          to 100%; therefore, it is much higher than if the exposure was not classified as defaulted.          The stricter the default definition, the higher the expected loss. If the expected loss is not          fully covered by the credit risk adjustments then the difference is deducted from own          funds. Moreover, the definition of default also impacts the risk weights of non-defaulted          exposures through PD estimates. A stricter default definition results in a higher default          rate, higher PD estimates and higher risk weights for non-defaulted exposures.	0

6.         The main issue raised was that it would be beneficial to clarify the categories of major and significant changes. It was also suggested that a definition of more concrete quantitative criteria for distinguishing between major changes and significant changes would be useful.

The implementation of this aspect will be reviewed by the EBA and taken into account when binding	                                                  Article 26                                             Applicability of Part IV	0

Nevertheless, the Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors (BCBS) notes that there exists potential for capital arbitrage within the credit risk mitigation framework, including use of credit risk mitigation for securitisation exposures, particularly when (i) there is a delay in recognising the cost of protection in earnings while (ii) the bank receives an immediate regulatory capital benefit in the form of a lower risk weight on an exposure on which it is nominally transferring risk. In such instances, there may be no meaningful transfer of credit risk.	15. The EBA publicly consulted on the draft proposal contained in this paper.

Below, the current practices observed for each technical option are compared with the provisions specified in the GL.	When the option is ITM, the sensitivities of the option is really close to the sensitivity of the bond, so the sensitivities of the puttable bond, for yield far higher than the par (e.g 8%) is close to zero. On the other hand, for yield much lower than the par yield (e.g. 4%) the delta sensitivities of the put option (OTM) tends to zero, and the vanilla and puttable bond delta sensitivities tend to converge.	0

The second method considered for purposes of risk classification is to use a continuous scale (which would not require setting buckets). Such a method would carry the advantage of allowing for extensive differentiation among institutions, which is particularly helpful if there is a high degree of heterogeneity among institutions. This advantage is partially counterbalanced by the complexity of calibrating this method for a large number of institutions. Taking into account the merits of the ‘bucket’ approach and the ‘sliding scale’ approach, depending on characteristics of the national banking sector, the preferred option is to include in the draft guidelines the flexibility to choose either of these approaches.	2.

Timely identification of default is important to make sure that accurate information is used for risk management purposes, for instance that the information on the default is available at the moment when further credit decisions are taken for the obligor. For that reason information about the default of a client should be available in the business units of the institution without undue delay and whenever information about the status of the obligor is used for any management purposes including internal or external reporting and calculation of capital requirements. Option c introduces principle-based guidance to institutions for setting the frequency of days past due. This option would not achieve full harmonisation with regard to the frequency of counting of days past due, but for the purpose of estimation of risk parameters the appropriate date of default would in any case have to be identified ensuring sufficient harmonisation in that regard. This option minimises the required modifications to IT systems and therefore does not lead to excessive operational costs.	                                            means the application of the prudential rules set out in                                             Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013                                             on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis, in                                             accordance with Part 1, Title 2, Chapter 2 of Regulation                                             (EU) No 575/2013.

    14. The general approach for data collection has not changed. As a result, the impact of the         transition to the new Guidelines is negligible, but some ongoing costs will be triggered         due to the higher granularity of the data collected. Furthermore, the number of high         earners per institution is limited and as a result this the costs for their allocation to         business lines is limited as well. Where competent authorities have already collected         information in April 2013, institutions will have minor additional costs for submitting a         revised report.	            b. the expected change in the institution’s funding profile arising from the execution                of the funding plan and whether this is suitable given the institution’s activities                and business model;	0

30. The costs of testing recovery plans against scenarios are mainly driven by the requirements     incorporated in the BRRD itself. The guidelines specify only the range of scenarios against     which recovery plans have to be tested. As a result, these guidelines will generate additional     compliance costs within those Member States where fewer scenarios than the number     proposed by the guidelines would have been required. These costs will mainly affect     institutions, which will have to test these scenarios, and, to a lesser extent, the NCAs, which     will have to verify whether the scenarios have been properly designed and tested.	29.

Directive (EU) 2015/849 provides that obliged entities can determine the extent of these measures on a risk-sensitive basis. It also provides that where the risk associated with the business relationship or occasional transaction is low, Member States may allow obliged entities to apply simplified customer due diligence (SDD) measures instead. Conversely, where the risk associated with the business relationship or occasional transaction is increased, obliged entities must apply enhanced customer due diligence (EDD) measures. However, the Directive does not set out in detail how obliged entities should assess the risk associated with a business relationship or transaction, nor does it set out exactly what SDD and EDD measures entail.	4.

In    particular, the Home DGS may request the Host DGS to conduct an audit of the Host DGS’s    activities related to the payout paid for by the Home DGS.	0

These guidelines aim to provide common organisational requirements, methodologies and    processes for the performance of stress testing by institutions, taking into account capital    adequacy and risk management, as part of their risk management processes (‘institutions’    stress testing’).

With regard to stress testing, comments related to, inter alia, the role of internal ICAAP stress tests in the context of P2G, clarifications of definitions, transparency of stress testing programmes (i.e. results to be disclosed to institutions in a timely and comprehensive manner, as supervisory stress tests might be associated with significant pressure on the resources of participating institutions), and communication of supervisory stress testing. Further comments related to, inter alia, the relationship between supervisory stress testing and the scenarios used in banks’ recovery plans. Some respondents also commented on the potentially different target ratios in supervisory systemwide stress tests and the implications of these for the level playing field.

The objective of the GL is to establish convergence of institutions’ practices and supervisory practices regarding the application of the definition of default. The GL are complementary to the RTS on the materiality threshold for credit obligations past due under Article 178(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (RTS on the materiality threshold) and specify indications and criteria for the application of the definition of default. Harmonisation of the current practices, which vary across Member States and institutions, is expected to enhance comparability of own funds and own funds requirements and to reduce the burden for cross-border institutions of complying with different regulatory frameworks.	                                                                                                    30 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN	0

The guidelines provide practical guidance for the coordinator and the competent authorities about how to provide each other with information.

It stressed that applying focus to higher risk firms was part of effective and     sufficient AML/CFT supervision and supported the ESAs’ assessment that greater detail could     stand in the way of competent authorities applying the guidelines to different sectors in a     proportionate and risk‐sensitive way.	8.3%	0

       In the example provided in Figure 4, in both transactions the first loss - up to the amount of the        junior tranche - is taken by the seller, and the second loss - up to the amount of the letter of        credit - is taken by the provider of the letter of credit, while the senior loss is taken by the ABCP        conduit which purchases the senior note. In the first transaction of Figure 4, the losses exceeding        the junior tranche are directly taken by a mezzanine tranche before any losses can be allocated        to the senior note. In the second transaction of Figure 4, the letter of credit guarantees a        subordinated portion of the senior tranche and therefore has the same economic effect as the        mezzanine tranche in the first transaction.	                                                                                             16 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS’ CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES	0

Revolving periods and other structural mechanisms resulting in the inclusion of exposures     in the securitisation after the closing of the transaction may introduce the risk that     exposures of lesser quality can be transferred into the pool. For this reason, it should be     ensured that any exposure transferred into the securitisation after the closing meets the     eligibility criteria, which are no less strict than those used to structure the initial pool of the     securitisation.	0

PSD2 also stays silent about to which CA complainants should submit their complaints. PSD2     establishes requirements on cooperation between CAs, including in a cross-border context. In     addition, Article 29(6) of PSD2 confers a mandate on the EBA to develop regulatory technical     standards specifying the framework for cooperation, and for the exchange of information,     between the CAs of the home and the host Member States. The EBA considers that these     measures are sufficient in allowing the complaint to reach the responsible CA.	0
       The objective of this criterion is to prohibit that STS ABCP transactions may qualify as a        resecuritisation. This is a lesson learnt from the financial crisis, when resecuritisations were        structured into highly leveraged structures in which notes of lower credit quality could be repackaged and credit enhanced, resulting in transactions whereby small changes in the credit        performance of the underlying assets had severe impacts on the credit quality of the        resecuritisation bonds. The modelling of the credit risk arising in these bonds proved very        difficult, also due to high levels of correlations arising in the resulting structures.	8.

The BRRD mandates the EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, to develop guidelines     specifying the range of scenarios to be used for the purposes of Article 5(6).

The EBA therefore expects all competent authorities and financial institutions to which guidelines are addressed to comply with guidelines. Competent authorities to which guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.	0
D. Cost-benefit analysis	The largest benefits of the implementation of these Guidelines would effectively accrue to consumers of banking products. The implementation of these requirements by manufacturers and distributors of banking products would reduce consumers’ risk of facing detriment and increase their trust in retail financial markets. Consequently, consumers could be expected to more confidently demand and enjoy the benefits which financial services generally may offer to them. Those beneficial attributes could be related to the smoothing of private households’ income streams over their lifetime or their insurance against severe adverse risks.	0

           Based on the EBA stock-take survey, in most Member States competent authorities apply            a proportional approach in their communication practices with auditors. The proportional            approach set out in the guidelines has taken into account the existing EU legislation on            identifying systemically important institutions, as well as the current practices of Member            States regarding the criteria used to identify cases when additional communication is            necessary. Therefore, compliance costs are expected to be relevant to some Member            States, who either do not currently apply a proportionate approach or use different            criteria to identify cases when there is need for more communication with auditors.            Overall, the costs of this option will be outweighed by the benefits of increased            convergence of communication practices across Member States (for those credit            institutions for which additional requirements are applied) and of effective supervision            with a sufficient degree of adaptability of communication.	    The present Guideline is limited to the outsourcing policy, specific aspects of     the issue of outsourcing are treated in the CEBS Guidelines on Outsourcing,     available at EBA‟s website.	0

Many respondents raised specific issues relating to sovereign exposures and exposures to public sector entities, where delay in payment often results from lengthy administrative procedures rather than from financial difficulties. It was suggested that these situations should be treated as technical defaults. Instead, a specific treatment has been specified in the guidelines that applies to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities.	In terms of frequency, disclosure requirements with higher than annual frequency would be a burden for small and medium-sized institutions, which might face resource constraints. The guidelines embed proportionality also in terms of frequency of disclosures, and only certain institutions are required to disclose some templates more frequently than annually (option 2).	0

These scenarios are applied to IRRBB exposures in each currency separately for which the institution has material positions10. The shock size for the six interest rate shock scenarios is based on historical interest rates. More precisely, for capturing the local interest rate environment and cycle, a historical time series ranging from 2000 to 201511 for various maturities is used to calculate the parallel, short-end (‘short’) and long-end (‘long’) shocks for a given currency. However, deviations from the above-mentioned 16- year period are permitted if they better reflect a particular jurisdiction’s idiosyncratic circumstances. Table 1 displays the values calculated for the parallel, short and long interest rate shocks for selected currencies. The shocks capture the heterogeneous economic environments across the jurisdictions. These are then used to calculate the shocks for different maturities of the yield curve to create the interest rate shock scenarios as per the methodology explained below.

27. At the highest level, these requirements are intended to contribute to improving consumer     protection in the EU, promoting the safety and soundness of the European banking system as     well as the stability, effectiveness and integrity of the financial system in a broader sense. In     addition, they should foster convergence of regulatory and market practices across the EU.     More specifically, these requirements aim at transparent, efficient and competitive mortgage     markets as well as flexible and fair credit agreements relating to immovable property by     promoting creditors’ sustainable lending decisions. At the technical level, the purpose of     these requirements is to give MS further detail on the provisions of Articles 18 and 20(1) of     the Mortgage Credit Directive and to assist the CAs in giving effect to those provisions.

b. the increasing reliance on outsourced ICT services and third party products, often in the form of        diverse packaged solutions resulting in manifold dependencies and potential constraints and new        concentration risks.	15.The EBA is updating the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing issued in 2006, which applied exclusively        to credit institutions, with the aim of establishing a more harmonised framework for the        outsourcing arrangements of financial institutions. The scope of application of these guidelines        covers not only credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD (referred to as        ‘institutions’), but also payment and electronic money institutions (referred to as ‘payment        institutions’). The guidelines are not directly addressed to credit intermediaries and non-bank        creditors that are subject to Directive 2014/17/EU6 or to account information service providers        that are only registered for the provision of service 8 of Annex I to the PSD2. Outsourcing        arrangements between institutions, payment institutions and such entities are within the scope        of the guidelines when such entities act as outsourcing service providers.	0
     72. These guidelines form part of the ESAs’ wider work on fostering consistent supervisory          practices and a common approach to AML/CFT, and need to be considered in that          context. The Risk Factors Guidelines equip firms with the tools they need to make          informed decisions on the effective identification, assessment and management of ML/TF          risk, and set common, regulatory expectations to which national competent authorities          will refer when assessing the adequacy of firms’ AML/CFT systems and controls. Other          ESA instruments, including the Joint Risk-Based Supervision Guidelines,36 complement          the Risk Factors Guidelines by specifying how competent authorities should organise          AML/CFT supervision. Together, they provide a solid foundation for promoting a coherent          and more harmonised supervisory response to AML/CFT challenges.

The BSG fully agrees with Article 32 of BRRD that establishes that extraordinary public financial support resulting from tests, reviews or equivalent exercises may not be considered as an automatic trigger for resolution when the institution fulfils the current minimum capital regulatory requirement and such support is provided (in accordance with the State Aid framework)     to    remedy      a   serious      disturbance  in    the    economy       of   a Member State and to preserve financial stability.	1.

Guidelines set out the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area. The EBA therefore expects all competent authorities and financial institutions to whom guidelines are addressed to comply with guidelines. Competent authorities to whom guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.	When the duration-based approach accounts for the prepayment risk, the corresponding level of own funds requirements is expected to fall. The background section (Section 3.2 in particular) of the draft CP explains in detail the logic for the argument.	0

The guidelines should help achieve the objectives of the new EU securitisation framework as     set out above, in a more efficient and effective way. They should help introduce an immediately     recognisable STS product in EU securitisation markets, increase investors’ trust in the STS     products that will be eligible for a more risk sensitive capital treatment and thereby allow     investors and originators to reap the benefits of simple, transparent and standardised     instruments.	0

        ►     Option A.1 - Limiting the scope of the guidelines to credit institutions only.	According to Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 any change in the definition of default is a material change that requires the approval of a competent authority. Therefore, the impact for the national supervisory authorities will come with the applications from the institutions that were granted permission to use the IRB Approach for material changes of rating systems related to the changes in the definition of default. Granting such approvals in a timely manner might cause a significant operational burden for the national supervisors. In order to ensure efficient implementation of the changes competent authorities will have to review and agree on individual implementation plans with these institutions and later verify the timely implementation of those plans.	0
  61. The BSG considered that the draft guidelines were conducive to firms adopting risk-based       AML/CFT policies and procedures. However, in some cases, greater detail was warranted       to reduce the risk of national competent authorities enforcing divergent expectations of       firms’ assessment and management of AML/CFT risk, for example in relation to       establishing a beneficial owner’s source of funds, the application of CDD measures to       non-face-to-face relationships and the appropriate management of lower risk       correspondent banking relationships.	                                                                                     compliance with these Guidelines is without prejudice                                                                                      to the compliance with the EBA Guidelines on sound                                                                                      remuneration policies under Articles 74(3) and 75(2)                                                                                      of Directive 2013/36/EU and disclosures under Article	0

29. Given that the design of the appropriate scenarios depends on the specific characteristics of     each institution (activity, size, interconnectedness, business and funding model, etc.), the     guidelines cast on institutions the responsibility of selecting relevant scenarios and vest NCAs     with the task of assessing the appropriateness of the chosen scenarios. However, at least     three scenarios are required by the guidelines (one covering a system-wide event, one     covering an idiosyncratic event and one covering a combination of both types of events), and     in order to build these scenarios the events identified in paragraphs 12-18 of the guidelines     must be duly considered by institutions/NCAs while designing/assessing the scenarios.     However, considering that the quality and effectiveness of the scenarios is strictly dependent     on each firm’s characteristics and weaknesses, relevant scenarios can be built considering     events different from those provided by paragraphs 12-18. This option must be properly     justified by the institution concerned and assessed by the competent authority.	               a.

I. Executive Summary The amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive1 by Directive 2010/76/EU (CRD III)2 relate to the approach for capturing Incremental Default and Migration risks in the trading book, commonly referred to as the incremental risk capital charge (IRC). According to these amendments, the predecessor of the EBA, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS)3 is tasked with monitoring the range of practices in this area and drawing up guidelines in order to secure a level playing field. The transposition by national supervisory authorities of the changes to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) by Directive 2010/76/EU (CRD III) entered into force on 31 December2011. Providing guidance on the IRC modelling approaches employed by credit institutions using the Internal Model Approach („IMA‟) for the calculation of the required capital for specific interest risk in the trading book, is seen as an important means of addressing weaknesses in the regulatory capital framework and in the risk management of financial institutions that contributed to the turmoil in global financial markets. The incremental risk charge is intended to complement additional standards being applied to the value-at-risk (VaR) modelling framework in the trading book and is expected to contribute to a more robust financial system. Among other things, the first chapter of the Guidelines, „Scope of Application‟ elaborates on the positions that are subject to IRC modelling and the permanent partial use of IRC models. The second chapter, on „Individual Modelling‟ provides guidance on the use and sources of individual parameters and ratings in IRC modelling. The third chapter, on „Interdependence‟ discusses i) the correlation between default and migration events, ii) copula assumptions, iii) systemic risk factors and iv) portfolio concentrations. Chapter four on „Migration matrices‟ elaborates on the use of transition matrices. Chapter five on the ‟Constant level of risk assumption over the one-year capital horizon‟ provides guidance on, among other issues, the use of liquidity horizons and the rebalancing of positions. Chapter six on „Hedging‟ goes into more detail on the modelling of diversification effects. The seventh chapter, on ‟P&L valuation‟ elaborates on how ratings changes are turned into impact on market prices and on the computation of P&L. Chapter eight on „Liquidity horizons‟ provides guidance on defining a liquidity horizon as well as on the key factors for determining the relevant liquidity horizon as well as on the monitoring of liquidity horizons. Chapter nine on „Validation‟ elaborates on the validation process for IRC models. Chapter ten on „Use tests‟ and chapter eleven, „Documentation‟ describe the minimum requirements for the use of IRC models and their related documentation. Chapter twelve on „IRC approaches based on different parameters‟ provides guidance on how to deal with IRC models that are „not fully	b. the control function is organisationally separate from the activities it is          assigned to monitor and control;	0

Promotional banks, guaranteed by federal or state governments, act on the basis of fulfilling a mandate of public interest. In order to fulfil this purpose, they must not only provide a high degree of creditworthiness, but also high flexibility to react at short notice to the offer- and supply- sides of capital markets. Refinancing of state guaranteed banks is part of public sector refinancing, based on their business model. The combination of long-term planning and adjusting of funding activities to market needs, will result in a lack of synchronization between planned values reported and the actual data. For promotional banks owned by the central government, the banking supervisors are unable to derive any control impetus at all from the planning of the funding activities. Considering these facts, and that no control-relevant insights are obtainable from this exercise, even though considerable costs and pooling of resources are to be expected, the added value of including central government guaranteed institutions is questionable. Thus, they should be exempt from the suggested obligations.	1.        Directive 2006/48/EC, Article 105states, in paragraph (1) that credit institutions may use Advanced Measurement Approaches (‘AMA’) based on their own operational risk measurement systems, provided that the relevant competent authority expressly approves the use of the models concerned for calculating the own funds requirement; in paragraph (2) it states that credit institutions shall satisfy their competent authorities that they meet the qualifying criteria set out in Annex X, Part 3 of the Directive.	0

In some cases, where the                risk associated with the relationship is particularly high, verifying the source of                wealth and the source of funds may be the only adequate risk mitigation tool. The                source of funds or wealth can be verified, inter alia, by reference to VAT and                income tax returns, copies of audited accounts, pay slips, public deeds or                independent media reports.	0

Outflow due to write-offs: full or partial write-offs of total loans and advances recorded during the reference period. A write-off (full or partial) constitutes a  de-recognition event. Therefore, the gross carrying amount of loans and advances is reduced by the amount of the write-offs. For the avoidance of doubt,  please note that this row reflects changes in the gross carrying amount of loans and advances, and any potential partial write-offs that have already been  reported in previous rows (e.g. accompanying sale of loans and advances, collateral liquidation, taking possession of collateral or significant risk transfer)  should not be included in this row.

They also argued that such a distinction could                             not be accurately or consistently applied. In                             some cases, the distinction would be relatively                             straightforward, for example for cards, but for                             P2P platform payments, for example, the                             distinction could be more difficult. The                             requirement to break fraud data down on this                             basis would then be more onerous and give                             rise to inaccurate data.

The value of residential or                                    commercial buildings is often driven by very local                                    attributes, which local valuation experts, rather                                    than international banks, are best placed to assess.                                    Similarly, the value of very specific types of                                    collateral (e.g. oil fields, coal mines) would be best                                    appraised by appropriate experts external to the                                    institutions. It would be disproportionate to expect                                    institutions to house this level of expertise simply to                                    be able to challenge external valuations on an ad                                    hoc/infrequent basis.

In line with the EBA’s mandate, these guidelines have been developed taking into account the current practices of Member States. Other existing international guidance and practices have been considered also, including the BCBS guidance on external audits of banks3 and the relevant work performed by the Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR) of the World Bank4.

In its proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervisions of credit institutions and investment firms (CRD IV), the EU Commission proposed that all members of the management body should be subject to an enhanced „fit and proper‟ test. This test is one of the reforms proposed by the European Commission to improve corporate governance practices. It was suggested that the EBA would                                                                                                 3 develop Binding Technical Standards regarding that issue to ensure a level-playing field .	The adjustment of data and recalibration of risk parameters may impose a significant operational burden on the institutions that use the IRB Approach. In particular, for those institutions that use numerous rating systems and where the definition of default will change significantly, the process of implementing necessary adjustments might be costly and time consuming.	0

The guidelines could set out high‐level principles, which reflect common understanding of     the RBS; these high‐level principles would be complemented by sufficient detail to achieve     supervisory convergence, while providing room for competent authorities to adjust their     approach in line with their legal and regulatory environment and the realities of their     financial sector.	        The identification of default results from a data or system error of the institution, including          manual errors in standardised processes but excluding wrong credit decisions.	0

The following sections of the impact assessment focus on justifying the decision for the specific provisions in the updated version of the Guidelines on institutions’ stress testing, and also on estimating the costs and benefits for institutions arising from the full implementation and ongoing application of the guidelines. It is noteworthy that the impact assessment quantifies the net impact from the full implementation of the guidelines, implying that the costs and benefits from the actual implementation of the guidelines arising from the exercise of a national discretion will be proportionate to the level of implementation in each Member State, i.e. Member States that do not fully implement the guidelines will incur less costs but will also benefit less from the advantages of the full implementation.	                                                                                                                   24 GUIDELINES ON STS CRITERIA FOR NON-ABCP SECURITISATION	0

Most respondents welcome the initiative to promote harmonised practices on risk-based contributions to DGSs across Member States. In particular, respondents support the mandatory ex-ante collection of contributions which they think will strengthen confidence in DGSs across Member States. However, due to the variety of national banking structures throughout the Union, respondents insist on there being sufficient degree of flexibility to accommodate the specific characteristics of those structures as far as possible.

Minor changes are those changes which may occur more often, but which do not have a severe impact on the reliability of the AMA framework or the capital charge. However, such changes also need to meet the requirements set out in Annex X, Part 3 of Directive 2006/48/EC. Further, a per se insignificant change, in conjunction with other changes, might have a significant impact and, in such cases, needs to be considered accordingly.	0
    Setting regulatory standards such as these guidelines is one element of this work, which is     still evolving and includes, among other things, the ESAs’ Joint Guidelines on simplified     and enhanced customer due diligence and the factors credit and financial institutions     should consider when assessing the ML/TF risk associated with individual business     relationships and occasional transactions. Together, these standards serve to create a     common understanding among European AML/CFT competent authorities of what the     risk‐based approach to AML/CFT entails and how it should be applied, while     acknowledging that due to the minimum harmonisation nature of Directive     (EU) 2015/849, some differences will continue to exist at the national level.	                                               relevant to them.                during its dialogue with a                                                Taking into account a big        competent authority                                                variety of business models,      regarding the content of the                                                the approach based on            recovery plan.                                                rebuttable presumption                                                avoids the need of creating                                                separate minimum lists of                                                indicators for different types                                                of institutions.

This is necessary as Directive 2013/36/EU allows Pillar 2 to be used for macro-prudential purposes. It requires competent authorities to take systemic risks, including the risks that an institution poses to the financial system, into account when carrying out the SREP. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has provided guidance on the use of Pillar 2 for macro-prudential purposes, including the role of the SREP, in its Handbook on Operationalising Macro-prudential Policy in the Banking Sector. It advises, amongst other things, that competent authorities coordinate with the national macro-prudential (designated) authority when evaluating systemic risks under the SREP and when addressing systemic risks by using Pillar 2 measures.	0

Where, however, the institution sells the credit obligations due to a decrease in their quality or the loss on that sale is otherwise related to the credit quality of the obligations, the materiality of this credit-related economic loss should be assessed. It is proposed that the loss should be assessed on the basis of the difference between the outstanding amounts of the obligations and the agreed price. If the economic loss is higher than a certain threshold the sale of the exposure should be considered an event of default.

While the general structure of the data collection has been retained, CRD IV requires information on the responsibilities of high earners to be collected in addition to the previous data. For this purpose, the Guidelines differentiate between management, senior management, staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution’s risk profile (identified staff), staff in control functions and other staff. As set out in the previous Guidelines, data for business areas are collected separately to ensure consistency with historical data. However, management and staff in corporate functions (e.g. Human Resources, IT etc.) were not assigned to a separate business line, but reported under 'all other'. To separate corporate functions from other business areas and independent control functions and to distinguish staff working in management from other senior managers, separate categories for these functions have been introduced. As a result, the data will be collected in a more granular way, which will also allow for a more meaningful analysis of the data.	5.1 Draft cost-benefit analysis/impact assessment Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 provides the EBA with the responsibility to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices, within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), to ensure the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law, and to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions.	0

Some issues were identified as part of the implementation of the EBA Guidelines on     harmonised definitions and templates for funding plans of credit institutions under     Recommendation A4 of ESRB/2012/2 (EBA/GL/2014/04), which were issued in 2014.     Specifically, the Q&A process and analysis of the data submitted made clear that some     clarifications and changes to the templates would be beneficial or in some cases indeed     necessary.

1    Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital	The EBA also received several comments in relation to the EUR 300 000 set threshold for the gross carrying amount of collateral above which credit institutions are not allowed to use indexed valuation. Most stakeholders argued that there were many factors (e.g. location of the property, purchasing power, economic environment, etc.) to be considered for collateral valuation and that this threshold would not be feasible given significant differences in these factors not only across jurisdictions but also within countries. The EBA acknowledges the difficulty of introducing one single threshold and, as explained in the feedback table, has changed the requirements so that the competent authorities are expected to set thresholds in their jurisdictions.	0

4. Remuneration policies and the application of proportionality differ significantly between    Member States and institutions. The guidelines on remuneration policies and practices    published by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors on 10 December 2010 (CEBS    guidelines) lead to some harmonisation regarding remuneration policies; however, the    achieved level of harmonisation is not yet sufficient. In particular the identification of staff    whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution’s risk profile, the ratio    of variable to fixed remuneration and the application of deferral of pay out of variable    remuneration still show significant differences. 40	                                                                                                   12          regarding the remuneration policy under Article 96 of Directive 2013/36/EU and          Article 450(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/20139.

4.1 Cost-benefit analysis / impact assessment Problem definition Following the mandate of Article 131(18), the RTS on specifying the methodology for the definition of Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) develop the methodology for identifying the EU institutions that could pose a threat to global financial stability and consequently assign them to sub-categories based on their systemic significance. Going further, Article 131(3) mandates the Member States’ designated authorities to identify other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), assessing their systemic importance by taking into account one or more of the criteria listed in that Article. The reference to O-SIIs includes (i) domestic systemically important institutions (institutions that are systemic in a given Member State) or (ii) EU systemically important institutions (institutions that are systemic at EU level without necessarily being systemic at the level of the Member States in which they are active).	•   The institution has a weak competitive                                                          position for its products/services in its                                                          chosen markets, and may have few business                                                          lines with good prospects.

21.   From the institutions’ perspective, when a branch is categorised as significant-plus it will be       subject to further risk assessment that will require more intense cooperation between the       home and host competent authorities and may eventually lead to the introduction of more       granularity in reporting. The costs associated with reporting due to the classification of a       branch as significant-plus are expected to increase the administrative burden for the branch.       However, Option 1b limits this increase in costs to a subset of significant branches only. This       marginal increase in costs is justified, as the expected benefits in terms of prudential regulation       are expected to exceed the costs.	113         Respondents pointed out that it is not the task       Principle 20 elaborates on the process and does not No             of a board of directors to approve new products       intend to shift the responsibility for such approvals to the change             and later changes.

10.      The extent to which the deferred part of remuneration may work as an incentive mechanism depends on what is, for the employee, the perceived value of this deferred remuneration when it is awarded. That is the net present value of remuneration which will only be obtained in the future. How a staff member perceives the net present value may differ between individual staff members. In general the perceived value depends on several factors: e.g. the expected return on another investment; the immediate financial needs the employee has; personal preferences; the risks of not being able to receive the full amount of deferred remuneration in the future; the reduction of the value due to inflation; and the uncertainty about future inflation rates. However, not all such elements are relevant for the discount rate. For example, clawback and malus mechanisms, which are part of the remuneration framework and are supposed to reduce the awarded remuneration if the institution or the staff member does not perform well, should not lead to an increase of the discount rate.	        c) the disclosure waiver related to proprietary information should not be used to avoid            disclosing information that would disadvantage an institution in the market because            that information reflects an unfavourable risk profile;	0

To compute the exposure metrics included in the two thresholds, above, the variable ‘FX loans to       households’ was used as a proxy for ‘FX loans to unhedged borrowers’, households being       considered the most relevant category of borrowers with neither a natural nor a financial hedge       against foreign currency risk.	0
If in the cases listed above the 90 days past due criterion is used for accounting purposes and creditimpaired status would be the only indication of default, such exposures may remain in non-defaulted status. These exemptions are necessary in order to make sure that the treatment of SCRA under	 2. Trust in the reliability of the banking system is crucial for its proper  functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole.  Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if  institutions, individually, and the banking system, are to operate well. It is on  the basis of this understanding and within the above-mentioned framework  that the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) had issued  guidelines covering either wholly or partially internal governance aspects: the  2006 Guidelines on Outsourcing; the 2006 Guidelines on Supervisory Review  Process; the 2009 High Level Principles on Remuneration; the 2010 High Level  Principles on Risk Management).	0

This is particularly the case for banks that     ‘fully loaded’ terminology is usually applied to refer                                     have an excess of accounting provisions over              to all transitional arrangements with an impact on                                     regulatory expected loss pre-IFRS 9 phase-in and          capital ratios.                                     for which that excess is eligible to be included in                                     Tier 2 Capital under CRR Article 62(d).

Current disclosure requirements on asset encumbrance in the accounting and regulatory        frameworks are not comprehensive, especially regarding unencumbered assets available        for encumbrance, common definitions and common presentation.

A key issue raised by many respondents is the applicability of the guidelines to different governance structures. Respondents were of the view that some provisions of the guidelines are not enforceable in or are not compatible with some governance structures adopted in Member States. For instance, in one-tier structures institutions have a unitary and inseparable body through which both management and supervisory functions are performed and where all members have the same responsibilities. Under some company laws, the body appointed by shareholders does not have executive functions and therefore some respondents felt that no requirements should be addressed to the management body in its management function; rather, they should be addressed to the senior management. A few respondents identified particular aspects that they deemed inappropriate for two-tier structures and for particular business models and/or governance systems, such as public or cooperative institutions. Overall, respondents advocated ensuring that the EBA guidelines are compatible with all governance models. In this context, some respondents believed that the definitions of the management body in its different functions should be clarified and that the notion of senior management should be used in the guidelines; in particular, ‘senior management’ should be included in the ‘management body in its management function’. In addition, it was argued that the notion of key function holders should not be part of the guidelines, as it is not included in Directive 2013/36/EU.	                                                                                                                                                                    130 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON FRAUD REPORTING UNDER PSD2	0

The BSG accepted the fact that the EBA is not responsible for establishing a rigid hierarchy of more or less intrusive measures and that the reference to proportionality is an adequate way to address this issue. In this context, the BSG expressed its view that the approach strikes a good balance. However, it noted that measures to remove or reduce impediments should in the first place focus on impediments to the preferred strategy. The text of the guidelines has been adjusted to reflect this comment.	0
Quantitative indicators with supervisory overlay	The guidelines propose that, when assessing liquidity risk and funding risk, competent authorities should assess the risk of an institution not being able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, either at all or without incurring unacceptable losses. For this purpose, the guidelines provide a set of common elements to be considered when assessing liquidity and funding risk and risk management and controls, including the internal liquidity assessment process (ILAAP).	0

   79. The policy option selected was to specify the procedures to be followed by the coordinator        and the competent authorities in specific selected areas which could benefit from enhanced        consistency and convergence of supervisory practices. The procedures are specified in the        following areas: activities of college, reflection of supervisory activities in the coordinated        action plan, sharing and delegation of tasks, and planning in emergency situations. As        regards the coordinated action plan, it is suggested that the relationship of supervisory        activities to the supervision of financial conglomerates should be marked separately in        college coordination action plans that already exist, to ensure that there is consistency and        to avoid duplication of activities of sectoral colleges.	10.3 Application of capital measures ............................................................................................. 172	0

Reporting requirements According to Article 16(3) of the EBA Regulation, competent authorities must notify the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with these guidelines, or otherwise with reasons for noncompliance , by 30 September 2014. In the absence of any notification by this deadline, competent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non-compliant. Notifications should be sent by submitting the form provided at Section 5 to compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference ‘EBA/GL/2014/02’. Notifications should be submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities.	a.

Option c provides institutions with full flexibility to adjust the level of application of the definition of default to internal risk management practices; however, it may lead to a lack of adherence to CRR requirements as regards the application of the definition of default at the obligor level. It is possible that one exposure of the obligor that is assessed at the facility level may be defaulted whereas other exposures remain in non-defaulted status even though the definition of default applies at the obligor level. Additionally, this does not allow comparability of default rates between portfolios.	       n)    where the legal person or entity has its head office in a third country, general             information on the regulatory regime of that third country as applicable to the legal             person or entity, including information on the extent to which the third country’s antimoney laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime is consistent with the             Financial Action Task Force Recommendations;	0
The EBA has identified differing practices used by institutions as regards the definition of default. Consequently these guidelines provide detailed clarification on the application of the definition of default, which includes aspects such as the days past due criterion for default identification, indications of unlikeliness to pay, conditions for a return to non-defaulted status, treatment of the definition of default in external data, application of the default definition in a banking group and specific aspects related to retail exposures. The EBA considers this harmonisation necessary in order to ensure a consistent use of the definition of default and to ensure that a harmonised approach is taken across institutions and jurisdictions. As a result the guidelines will increase comparability of risk estimates and own funds requirements, especially when using IRB models, and will help reduce the burden of compliance for cross-border groups – thus reducing overall RWA variability across institutions.

The respondent therefore suggested                              incorporating this section into the wording of the actual                              guidelines (from p. 10). Paragraph 57, too, contains an                              important statement on proportionality, which would gain                              in value by being applied to the guidelines as a whole.

The directive will be applied jointly with other national and EU legislation that may have a direct or indirect impact on the resolvability of institutions. The proposed measures and the circumstances when implemented will need to account for compliance with mandatory EU law coming into force after the directive. To this extent the relationship between the different sets of measures does not need clarification or guidance. However, being silent on the complementarities between the measures to address impediments to resolvability and other regulatory proposals that also have an impact on the legal, operational and financial structure of an institution, as suggested under Option 1, could create gaps and could impede the implementation of resolution powers. If the objectives of the various regulatory initiatives are different from those in the directive or do not ensure resolvability in individual cases, resolution authorities are required by Directive 2014/59/EU to address any remaining impediments to	    e) the expertise and independence of the appraiser.	0

For clients to which the EU accounting    rules do not apply (e.g. natural persons, central governments and clients that prepare    consolidated accounts in accordance with the accounting rules of a third country), the guidelines    provide a non-exhaustive list of criteria and indicators of control. This list is divided into two    different sets: the first set consists of criteria that always constitute a control relationship among    clients; the second set includes examples of indicators that should be considered by institutions in    their assessment, as any of these indicators might constitute a control relationship among clients.	(11). Paragraph 30 of the Guidelines is replaced with:          ‘Competent authorities should ensure that through the scoring of individual risks to          capital, liquidity and funding they provide an indication of the potential prudential impact          of a risk to the institution (e.g. potential loss) after considering the quality of risk controls          to mitigate this impact (i.e. residual risk) but before considering capital or liquidity          resources.’	0

  Moreover, this implies, for the example above, that the institution should estimate two downturn   LGDs for the calibration segment (A) mortgages, one relating to downturn period 1 (1990-1991,   specified based on the house price index) and another related to downturn period 2 (2008-2010,   defined on the basis of GDP growth, unemployment rate and total household debt), and pick as   the relevant downturn period the period that results in the higher of the two downturn LGD   estimates, considered as averages at calibration segment level. This comparison is necessary   because, otherwise, different grades could refer to different downturn periods, which would   result in undue complexity and would lack economic rationale.	            i.

The guidelines specify the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area. The EBA therefore expects all competent authorities and financial institutions to whom the guidelines are addressed to comply with the guidelines. Competent authorities to whom guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory processes), including where guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.	0

14.   In addition to the above requests, some respondents also asked the EBA to include definitions of       the terms ‘critical assets‘, ‘continuous monitoring‘, ‘internal and external factors‘, ‘service       providers‘ and ‘detective measures to identify possible information leakages’. The EBA considered       that, in line with the overarching intention to draft high-level requirements, it would not be       appropriate to define those terms and that they should instead be interpreted according to their       generic meaning. This will also allow PSPs to adapt those requirements to the range of payment       services they offer and related threats, and provide them with a degree of flexibility to adapt their       legal and institutional solutions to comply with the requirements set out in the Guidelines.

Timely identification of default is important to make sure that accurate information is used for risk management purposes, for instance that the information on the default is available at the moment when further credit decisions are taken for the obligor. For that reason information about the default of a client should be available in the business units of the institution without undue delay and whenever information about the status of the obligor is used for any management purposes including internal or external reporting and calculation of capital requirements. Option c introduces principle-based guidance to institutions for setting the frequency of days past due. This option would not achieve full harmonisation with regard to the frequency of counting of days past due, but for the purpose of estimation of risk parameters the appropriate date of default would in any case have to be identified ensuring sufficient harmonisation in that regard. This option minimises the required modifications to IT systems and therefore does not lead to excessive operational costs.	 General comments	0

Among the responses in the category ‘other’, one institution mentioned that it selects       the data used in downturn estimation according to exposures that default during the       downturn period. One institution mentioned a three-step approach: (1) downturn periods       are identified if the house price index has decreased; (2) the average house price decline       during the downturn period is calculated; and (3) the recovery rate under downturn periods       is computed by subtracting the average house price decline from the usual recovery rate.       Other institutions mentioned a combination of selecting all exposures that defaulted during       the downturn period for the unsecured part of the exposure, and selecting all exposures for       which the recovery process ends during the downturn period for the secured part of the       exposure.	Finally, some respondents underlined that it should be made clear that a test or a review should be supported by a clear and detailed common methodology. Since such emphasis is already made in the draft Guidelines and in particular in its paragraph 14 which states that “a test or review should be supported by a clear and detailed common methodology “, the Guidelines was not modified.	0

Therefore, relying on quantitative thresholds only is not an effective and precise benchmark for identifying the materiality, proprietary or confidentiality of information for disclosure.	0

8.     The respondents suggested that the requirements regarding management bodies should be spelled out in more detail, differentiating between the differing functions of management bodies and the different governance structures (1-tier and 2-tier systems). The EBA refrained from providing this level of detail in its Guidelines, which are not legally binding and need to be implemented by national competent authorities. A functional concept like management body is the most appropriate way of ensuring that all the different forms of national company law can be complied with.	p.1)	0

In general, the outlined Guidelines contribute to the EBA’s objective of fostering regulatory and supervisory convergence and the development of a single market for payment services in the Union. They will contribute to consistent, efficient and effective implementation of the provisions of PSD2 and enhance supervisory convergence across Member States. 3	    2. Guidelines set out the EBA’s view of appropriate supervisory practices within the        European System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a        particular area. Competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU)        No 1093/2010 to whom guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their        practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory        processes), including where guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.	0

28. Mortgage borrowing for the purchase of private real estate property is one of the most     important financial commitments of a large number of consumers of financial services.     Firstly, the borrowed amount often significantly exceeds the actual wealth and annual     income of mortgage borrowers. Secondly, the length of the commitment often exceeds a     specific period in the life cycle of borrowing individuals. Thirdly, the decision to borrow and     purchase private real estate property by a mortgage loan significantly affects multiple areas     of the consumer’s life, including his/her family situation.	            b. are reflected in a score assigned in accordance with the specific guidance                provided in the element-specific title of these guidelines;	0

               (ii)    irrespective of such general principles, specific criteria should be developed,                        based on specifying a minimum period for an entity to perform the business of                        originating similar exposures, compliance with which would enable the entity                        to be considered to have a sufficient expertise. Such expertise should be                        assessed at the group level, so that possible restructuring at the entity level                        would not automatically lead to non-compliance with the expertise criterion.                        It is not the intention of such specific criteria to form an impediment to the                        entry of new participants to the market.

The cost-benefit analysis assessed the net monetary impact of the operational changes proposed for implementation in relation to the current operational costs relating to the conduct of stress testing. The net impact on capital requirements, implied by the implementation of the current guidelines, cannot be precisely assessed; however, it is expected to be close to zero when quantifying it as a percentage of the total operational cost of a bank.	                                                                                                                                                                      37 GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES	0

This analysis is based on, among other, additional input received during    the public consultation from industry on the impact of the application of these principles to all    institutions, particularly to small and non-complex institutions, and on the impediments for a    full application as a starting point. To this end the EBA has submitted its opinion to the    European Commission in parallel with the publication of these guidelines.	0

Sudden losses of confidence of depositors in the banking system and large-scale withdrawals of deposits can put the stability of the financial system at risk. To prevent bank runs and confidence crises, DGS are set up in all Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA). According to the latest estimate available, covered deposits in the EU amounted to around EUR 7 000 billion (at the end of 2012), two-thirds of the eligible deposits (EUR 10 500 billion) and nearly half of the total deposits (EUR 14 650 billion) held with EU credit institutions 9. For Euro Area monetary financial institutions (MFIs), deposits by households and non-financial corporations resident in other Euro Area Member States stood at EUR 655 billion (at the end of March 2015) 10. Cross-border deposits account for around 5% of total non-MFI deposits held at credit institutions in the Euro Area 11. At the same time, there are around 750 branches of credit institutions in EU Member States controlled by credit institutions from other EEA Member States. These types of foreign branches constitute more than 10% of all credit institutions operating in the EU. Depending on the Member State, those branches cover up to 30% of national banking sectors’ total assets12. The amount of non-MFI deposits held with foreign banks stood at EUR 2 300 billion in the EU and EUR 1 500 billion in the Euro Area. Those deposit values represent more than 10% of non-MFI deposits held with banks, for both the EU and Euro Area as of June 2014 13. Finally, at the end of 2013, there were 30 credit institutions in the EU identified as globally systemically important (G-SIIs), based on their cross-jurisdictional activity and other assessment indicators 14. The cross-border nature of many of the EU’s credit institutions and their activities calls for effective cooperation between the relevant authorities to ensure financial stability in the EU, 9     EC: JRC technical report on updated estimates of EU eligible and covered deposits (2014). 10      ECB: MFI Balance Sheet Statistics (March 2015). 11      ECB: Financial Integration in Europe (2015). 12      ECB: Banking Structures Report (2014). 13      ECB: Consolidated Banking Data (June 2014). 14      http://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/global-systemically-important-institutions	                                                                Report the fair value of all securities classified as HFT, which includes                                                                 any securities for which the fair value option is elected (designated at                                                                 fair value (DaFV)).

11.Finally, the EBA has assessed the proposal to define ‘operational or security incident’ instead of    ‘major operational or security incident’, but has discarded the idea, since the EBA believes that    the term that needs to be defined in the Guidelines is the one that PSD2 refers to. Nevertheless,    the definition has been amended to improve clarity by dropping the term ‘material’ and    explaining further what ‘major’ is.

As the definition of default is particularly important for the IRB Approach and is the basis for estimation of all risk parameters, own funds requirements and expected loss calculation, specific requirements with regard to internal governance have been clarified for institutions that use the IRB Approach. In order to ensure that the default definition is implemented in a correct manner it should be approved by the management body, or by a committee designated by it, and by senior management in line with Article 189 of the CRR. Furthermore, in order to provide clarification on the so-called ‘use test’ requirements specified in Article 144 of the CRR it has been specified that these institutions should use the definition of default consistently for the purpose of own funds requirement calculation and internal risk management processes at least in the area of monitoring of exposures and internal reporting to senior management and the management body. Finally, the internal audit or another comparable independent auditing unit should review regularly the robustness and effectiveness of the process used by the institution for the identification of default of an obligor in accordance with Article 191 of the CRR.	0

Both competent authorities confirmed that most information (approximately 60%) related to banks that were authorised by them was freely available either from their own activities or from public registers. CAI highlighted that the most challenging part of the mapping exercise was deciding on the exact data that were required to perform the mapping. Once this was clear, it was easy to extract these data from the public register. Yet, both competent authorities found it challenging to gather information about branches of banks operating in their jurisdiction with a head office in another EEA state or in a third country.	       i. the funding structure of the institution;	0

The regulatory objective that has to be safeguarded is the financial stability of the European banking system. The operational objective to achieve financial stability comprises the increase of capital buffers for G SIIs. The additional buffer will also partially mitigate or entirely eliminate the kick-off effects of the failure of a G-SII on the rest of the banking system and the economy. Going one step backwards, the set of G-SIIs should be defined along with their relative significance. The draft RTS further specify the methodology set out in general terms in the Directive.

10. The EBA has assessed all of the responses and has arrived at the following conclusions.     Firstly, given the high level of fraud observed on internet payments and its increasing trend     over recent years2, the EBA does not consider the preference of some respondents to delay     the implementation of the guidelines until the transposition of the PSD 2 in 2017/18 to be a     plausible option. Fraud figures on card internet payments alone, with EUR 794 million in     fraud losses in 2012 (up by 21.2% from the previous year) for card-not-present fraud,     illustrate that a lack of security is continuing to undermine the confidence of market     participants in payment systems and therefore that a timely and consistent regulatory	8 ()      OJ L […], [xx.xx.XXXX, p…].	0

This applies at all stages: the setting of the bonus pool, the actual award of remuneration and    the application of ex post risk adjustments.

The respondent also suggested that, where                             the payee’s PSP itself acts as a PIS, it may be                             particularly confusing.	Date of application	0

For illustration purposes, calculations in this example are carried out for a Member State A in year 2X01. There are only three credit institutions and one DGS in that Member State and the total amount of deposits covered by the DGS is EUR 1,500,000. It is assumed that year 2X01 is the first year when the DGS in Member State A starts collecting ex-ante contributions from deposit-taking institutions in order to reach a target level of 0.8% of covered deposits in 10 years (i.e. by year 2X11). Therefore, in line with the requirement to spread contributions as evenly as possible, the annual target level, representing total annual contributions (C) from all institutions in Member State A in year 2X01, should be approximately 1/10 of the target level. The contribution rate (CR) in this case amounts to 0.0008 (CR = 1/10 × 0.8%). The total annual contributions for year 2X01 should be calculated as follows: C = EUR 1,500,000 x (0.0008) = EUR 1,200.

During a one-month    consultation period six responses were received to the Consultation Paper. Responses varied,    with one respondent requesting that further information be included in the notification and    another requesting that some information be deleted. Respondents also commented on the    language and means of transmission of the notification.

The objective of these guidelines is to establish convergence between institutions’ methodological choices in estimating downturn LGD estimates. These methodological choices are considered to be drivers of unjustified RWA variability; hence the harmonisation of the current practices is expected to increase the comparability of own funds requirements. The guidelines introduce three different type of approaches to estimate the downturn LGD, taking into account the data availability of the institution. The most appropriate approach should be used.            The first and optimal approach should be relied on when loss data reflecting the impact of             an economic downturn (identified in accordance with the draft RTS on the specification of             the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn) are available. In this case, the             institution can model the downturn directly.            The second approach comes into play if insufficient data are available, in which case the             institution has the choice of quantifying the downturn adjustment using a limited set of             methodologies.	1  Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC, (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 12).	0

The level of application of the default definition for retail exposures should be based on the internal risk management practices of the institution. However, if an institution decided to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures, the requirements of the CRR regarding default of an obligor might not be fully met. In particular, where the definition of default is used at the obligor level, default of any exposure of an obligor should result in default of all other exposures of this obligor. Where, however, some exposures of such an obligor are assessed at the individual facility level, default on one of these exposures would not result in default of all the obligor’s exposures. In order to avoid such a situation it is proposed that where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for different types of retail exposures they should provide evidence that there are no or a very limited number of situations where the same clients are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application.	• Reworking accounts	0

Option b finds a balance between the two previous options. While it creates a level playing field for the institutions and the regulators, it also provides flexibility to adjust the level of application of the definition of default to internal risk management practices, especially for entities located in different jurisdictions. At the same time it ensures compliance with the CRR in that where the definition of default is applied at the obligor level all exposures of an obligor are defaulted at the same time. Under option b costs may be incurred due to routine monitoring of the number of common clients between portfolios. However, the benefits are expected to exceed the costs. Therefore, the preferred option is option b.	iii.   the beneficiary of the policy or the beneficial owner of this beneficiary is a PEP;	0

Banks should not be made accountable for information                     that is not available, or not made available by its customers or                     counterparts. Additionally, connections, particularly arising from                     economic dependencies, are likely to change frequently and a bank                     can only reasonably be expected to update this information when                     going through its regular review cycle or if information that a                     dependency has changed is brought to its attention.	0

As the MCD sets out in Recital 27, foreclosure can have significant consequences on      consumers, and it states that it is appropriate to encourage creditors to deal proactively with      emerging credit risk at an early stage and that the necessary measures are in place to ensure      that creditors exercise reasonable forbearance and make reasonable attempts to resolve the      situation through other means before foreclosure proceedings are initiated. The MCD, in      Article 28, sets out provisions on arrears and foreclosure, and specifically requires MS to      adopt measures to encourage creditors to exercise reasonable forbearance before      foreclosure proceedings are initiated.	0
9.      The level of improvement in consumers’ abilities to meet their financial commitments has         therefore been small across the 28 MS. Of the 32 states included in the statistics, 14 had         arrears levels equal to or in excess of the level for the 28 MS in 2013 (11.8% of the         population); 11 states had arrears levels less than the 2013 level and figures for the         remaining seven states were unavailable. For the 25 states where figures for both 2012 and         2013 were available, the level of arrears increased in 12 states, decreased in 12 states and         remained unchanged in one state. The statistics suggest that in the majority of states         household arrears remain above the level for the 28 MS, thus suggesting that this remains a         concern in those states.

Comparison between fees is made more difficult if PSPs use different terminology for the same services and provide information in different formats. Standardised terminology, coupled with targeted fee information presented in a consistent format covering the most representative services linked to payment accounts, may help consumers to understand and compare fees.	0

To ensure a level playing field and to meet the requirements of the CRD, PSD2 and EMD, the EBA is now updating the guidelines issued by its predecessor to establish one common framework for the outsourcing of all financial institutions within the scope of the EBA’s action. To cater for the principle of proportionality and in accordance with the approach taken in the MiFID II and PSD2, the guidelines require that the outsourcing of critical or important functions be identified and impose stricter requirements on such outsourcing compared with other outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines aim to clarify the supervisory expectations regarding outsourcing to service providers, including service providers located in third countries, to ensure that outsourcing is performed in an orderly manner and not performed to an extent that would lead to the setting up of empty shells that no longer have the substance to remain authorised.	27.5.2014, p. 77). 18   Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).	0

The institution would like to award a staff member total remuneration of EUR 285 000, of which EUR 135 000 is to be fixed remuneration and a potential amount of EUR 150 000 is to be variable remuneration.

The ratio of variable/fixed remuneration based on nominal amounts would in this case be above the admissible 1:1 ratio. However, after application of the discount rate to the portion of variable remuneration paid in instruments deferred for a period of at least five years, the ratio is compatible with Article 94(1)(g) of Directive 2013/36/EU as shown below.	0

Moving from this premise, to ensure that recovery plans are tested against the main types of system-wide and idiosyncratic events, the guidelines identify the specific factors and events that should be taken into account in determining the appropriate scenarios. These factors have been selected as those that most typically threaten the failure of institutions or groups. However, the overriding principle remains	0

These Guidelines apply to competent authorities and credit institutions as defined in art. 4(1) of Directive 2006/48/EC, to financial holding companies as defined in article 4 (19) of Directive 2006/48/EC, and to mixed financial holding companies as defined in article 2 (15) of Directive 2002/87/EC in case of a financial conglomerate whose most important sector is banking as defined in article 3 (2) of Directive 2002/87/EC, all referred to here as credit institutions. The role of holding companies differs from the role of credit institutions, therefore the process and the criteria for the assessment of the suitability should be applied in a proportionate way, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the financial holding company and the particular relationship of the member of the management body or key function holder with the credit institution.	0

The guidelines apply on a different scope of consolidation from the IFRS requirements. For example, the focus of the guidelines is on gauging the resilience of banking activity in Europe within consolidated banking groups according to the regulatory scope as defined in the CRR, so the guidelines do not require disclosure of encumbrance arising from activities within insurance entities. Nonetheless, where insurance activities result in the encumbrance of assets held by an institution, all of these encumbering activities are required to be disclosed.
